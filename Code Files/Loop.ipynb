relationship between the two companies.  ansys will demonstrate a variety of industry-specific digital twins at ge\\'s  minds  machines event in san francisco, dedicated to building the digital industrial ecosystem. simulation technology is no longer solely used by engineers to design better products and reduce the costs of physical testing. leading organizations are expanding the use of simulation into operations by creating digital twins - virtual representations of individual operating assets whose performance and productivity can be improved dynamically through simulation technology. coupling the rich sensor data from increasingly smart industrial equipment with the predictive power of simulation, specific operating conditions can be analyzed and failure points predicted, unlocking billions of dollars in production and maintenance optimization. digital twins can live with the asset, providing a dynamic self-teaching model used to optimize its performance in conjunction with an industrial internet of things (iiot) platform. this combination of machine learning, coupled with physics-based modeling, enables organizations to see how their products performed in the past and predict the future simultaneously. using ansys to create model-based digital twins will provide a foundation to scaling the benefits of the iiot. this is no longer a theoretic concept as ansys and ge global research are already demonstrating actual implementation of digital twins, like the guardeon molded case circuit breaker, a powerful low-voltage circuit breaker designed for global industry applications. by using ansys software, ge engineers are able to study and test complex physics at a level of detail that was impossible to achieve through physical testing. \"pairing

the collaboration seamlessly integrates ibm\\'s deep learning analytics into pelco\\'s video management system (vms), leveraging data from video footage to quickly identify and respond to potential risks or opportunities. the analytics can quickly analyze huge volumes of archived video to identify people and objects of interest, dramatically decreasing the time needed for video forensic analyses. in addition, the solution identifies patterns of movement and behavior that help cities and enterprises mitigate risk and lower operational costs through improved processes and better policy enforcement. today, video surveillance cameras create more than 850 petabytes of data per day*, making it prohibitively expensive, if not impossible, for surveillance professionals to watch and analyze all of the captured footage. additionally, only three percent of video cameras have any intelligent capabilities. without enhanced analytics and automated processes, those that depend on video surveillance are only getting a small fraction of the value. the alliance between pelco and ibm will enable a new level of customization through end-to-end,code-level integration that includes hardware, vms and analytics capabilities in one truly seamless solution.\"we will deliver new solutions powered by ibm\\'s intelligent video analytics (iva) for cities, airports and schools utilizing

company, in an effort to strengthen i.b.m.'s position in the fast-growing market for computing sold to businesses as a service delivered over the internet. as businesses demand more services delivered over the internet, the titans of technology are stepping up their offerings delivered from data centers afar, so-called cloud computing.i.b.m. made a big move on tuesday, announcing that it had agreed to buy softlayer technologies, a cloud computing company, in an effort to strengthen its position in the fast-growing market. the purchase price was not disclosed. but it was about $2 billion, according to a person told of the negotiations, who has asked not to be named because he had not been authorized to speak publicly about the terms. the acquisition is the largest made under the leadership of virginia m. rometty, who became chief executive in january 2012. the purchase, analysts say, also gives i.b.m. a broader presence in the business of cloud computing services. amazon is the leader in the public cloud arena, and its roster of customers includes not just start-ups and research projects, but also large companies like netflix.amazon does not break out the revenue for its cloud business, amazon web services, but it is growing fast. the unit had estimated revenue of $2 billion last year,  according a recent research report from barclays, which forecast that amazon's cloud business would reach $5 billion or more by 2014.i.b.m. executives say its strategy is to compete in the public cloud market not with basic computing capabilities like processing and storage, but with software for marketing, procurement and customer service delivered as cloud offerings. since 2007, the company has spent $4.5 billion on more than a dozen acquisitions to build up its cloud software and services offerings.''we're focusing on business services that leverage the cloud model,'' said ric telford, vice president fori.b.m. cloud services.i.b.m.'s first moves in the cloud market date to 2007. but its early emphasis, analysts say, had mainly been on so-called private clouds, in which the computing is delivered to users as service over the internet, but from data centers owned by i.b.m.'s corporate customers. but the softlayer acquisition will sharply expand i.b.m.'s capability to deliver computing services remotely to customers from i.b.m. data centers -- the so-called public cloud model.softlayer, a private company based in dallas, has a network of 13 data centers in the united states, singapore and amsterdam, and revenue of about $400 million a year. gi partners, a private equity fund based in menlo park, calif., is the majority owner of softlayer. the softlayer data centers will be added to the 10 cloud services data centers i.b.m. now has worldwide.erich clementi, a senior vice president for i.b.m.'s technology services unit, said softlayer ''completes our portfolio.'' it expands i.b.m.'s public cloud operations, he said, while adding expertise and technology for private clouds and hybrid services, which blend the public and private models.lance crosby, chief executive of softlayer, said his company's long-term goal had been to become ''the defacto and most flexible platform for internet cloud computing. and we couldn't get there on our own.'' i.b.m., he said, has the financial resources and relationships with corporate customers to accelerate the adoption of its cloud technology.beyond the acquisitions, i.b.m. hopes to offer the company's homegrown technology as cloud services, like its watson artificial intelligence software, which i.b.m. announced last month was being tailored as a smart customer service assistant.''watson has a lot more potential because of the cloud delivery model,'' mr. telford said.dannon, the yogurt maker, is a cloud services customer that reflects the i.b.m. strategy. it uses i.b.m. public cloud software for optimizing its pricing, promotions and product planning. the cloud software has helpeddannon's sales planning teams improve the percentage of products sold to consumers to 98 percent from 75percent -- crucial for a food stuff with a limited shelf life. the software was developed by demandtec, whichi.b.m. acquired last year.in new projects, dannon, owned by the french company danone, is now pursuing a ''cloud-first strategy,'' said timothy weaver, the chief information officer.i.b.m. has earmarked its cloud business as an area for investment and growth. that business grew 70percent in the first quarter of 2013 from the quarter a year earlier. by 2015, i.b.m. has forecast that its cloud business should reach $7 billion, including private and public cloud services.all the major technology companies -- including microsoft, emc, hewlett-packard and oracle -- are pursuing cloud strategies. but analysts say i.b.m., perhaps more than any other company, can assure corporate customers to feel comfortable putting their business information in remote data centers and buying public cloud services.more than a decade ago, i.b.m. demonstrated that endorsement effect, when it made a big commitment to linux, the open-source operating system, helping it become a mainstream technology in corporate data centers.''i.b.m. is very much a trusted brand here,'' said steven milunovich, an analyst at ubs securities. ''once they show up, they tend to have a big impact.'\", 'ibm and twitter might seem like unlikely partners. one is the classic button-down business technology company, while the other is the freewheeling hub of online communication in bursts of 140 characters or fewer. but their partnership, announced on wednesday, makes a lot of sense. it is intended to give ibmã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢sdata-analysis business, including its watson artificial-intelligence technology, broad access to one of the worldã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s richest data sources ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x80\\x9d

should have ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93nearly limitless applications.ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9din the future, mr. moody predicted, ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93every significant business decision will have twitter input.ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9dif so, ibm wants to be the technology vehicle for delivering twitter-enhanced decisions. alistair rennie, general manager for big data and analytics at ibm, called the collaboration with twitter a ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93landmark partnershipã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d and one that, by exploiting twitterã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s unique data asset, will open the door to ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93business decisions based on the pulse of the planet.ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9dthe ibm and twitter executives announced the partnership at a conference on data analysis hosted by ibmin las vegas. later, in a joint interview, mr. moody and mr. rennie declined to discuss the financial terms of the partnership. but if the companies could achieve their vision of using twitter to improve business decisions spanning everything from marketing to product development, mr. moody said it would be a ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93great revenue opportunityã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d for both parties.most twitter messages are public. analysts at ibm and at other companies routinely pore through twitter traffic for early signals of market trends and consumer sentiment on behalf of corporate clients. and twitter has increasingly worked with companies and nonprofit researchers. at the conference, mr. moody mentioned a project with scientists at harvard medical school to study food poisoning by mining twitter messages. he noted that an unnamed manufacturer of commercial fryers, like those used in fast-food restaurants, found that tweets with the phrase ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93soggy friesã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d were an advance sign of equipment malfunctions. twitterã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s work with other companies, mr. moody said, will continue. but the ibm partnership, he noted, is in aã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93new category,ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d given the breadth of the activities.ibm, mr. moody said, will have ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93full fidelityã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d access to twitter data ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x80\\x9d all public messages and the archives of past messages. the two companies will also jointly develop software tools tailored to business customers, and ibm will train thousands of its consultants to use twitter data for clients. knowing how to handle twitter data in business, mr. moody noted, is a ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93huge gapã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d for most companies, and the ibm consulting force should help bridge that gap. in the announcement, ibm said it planned first to integrate twitter data in its cloud-based data analysis services, including watson analytics. the two companies will also develop software applications that map customer sentiment for use in sales, marketing and customer service. by incorporating twitter data into its software, ibm, according to mr. rennie, will be able to offer twitter-enhanced products to large numbers of business customers rather than having each one be a start-from-scratch project. with this partnership, twitter is the latest well-known company to join with ibm in recent months in fast-growing fields. ibm teamed up with sap in cloud computing and with apple in data-driven software applications for iphones and ipads.these partnership deals all come in the context of ibmã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s seeking growth in promising new businesses faster than those

insights apis, bloomfire customers can now automatically tag content to significantly improve users\\' ability to search and find information. tagging online content with relevant keywords provides corporate knowledge repositories with critical data that makes searching for information much more effective. most users of these types of systems neglect to tag their posts and most knowledge management systems lack the functionality to proactively suggest tags, limiting search capabilities. in fact, bloomfire\\'s own research suggests that properly tagged content is over 50percent more searchable than non-tagged content. this integration will help solve that problem by suggesting keywords and phrases that are related to the content being added.ibm watson enables organizations to quickly use natural language processing capabilities and data exploration to discover valuable information in both structured and unstructured data. when a bloomfirecustomer uploads content or a blog post, watson immediately identifies contextually relevant keywords and phrases for tagging. it then displays those words and phrases to ensure they are appropriate, and the user can modify the tags or simply accept them. with this sophisticated tagging process in place, users are able to search in natural language and instantly retrieve relevant content, expertly culled from a variety of internal data sources. bloomfire has a diverse customer base that will benefit from this new functionality, including whole foods, dun & bradstreet and etsy, among others.\"ibm is a pioneer in cognitive

mobile devices. it\\'sbetting that the next generation of electronics will have interfaces based around things like touch, motion sensing and voice, and it\\'s trying to get ahead of that trend. in april, the company created a $100 million fund to invest in such technologies', 'intel corp. to intensify its efforts in a hot new computing market, is taking the unusual step of relying on technology developed by a startup it acquired.the chip maker, determined to counter rival nvidia corp.\\'s lead in the field known as deep learning, said it would begin shipping chips in 2017 that it acquired through its purchase earlier this year of startup nervanasystems. intel said it plans to integrate nervana chips and software with its general-purpose xeonmicroprocessors, which are used in most corporate data centers. deep learning is a fast-growing branch of the broader field called artificial intelligence, which refers to systems that train themselves by analyzing large sets of data rather than being programmed in conventional ways. companies such as alphabet inc.\\'s google, facebook inc. and microsoft corp. are widely using deep-learning techniques to improve computers\\' ability to identify speech and objects in images, among other tasks. many companies now carry out those chores using a combination of intel xeon chips and nvidia chips called gpus, for graphics processing units. intel, though it didn\\'t mention nvidia by name, said it expects the nervana technology will allow it to train deep-learning systems 100 times faster than with a gpu.\"the gpu architecture does not have a unique advantage for ai,\" said brian krzanich, intel\\'s chief executive, at a san francisco gathering focused on the technology. \"it\\'s not the only solution that is out there.\"intel and others are placing multiple technology bets in the field. besides gpus, companies such as microsoft are also using chips known as field programmable gate arrays, or fpgas, for deep-learning applications. intel jumped on that trend by buying altera corp., the biggest fpga maker, in its biggest-ever transaction. in addition to nervana, intel in september cut a deal to buy movidius ltd., another startup that specializes in vision-related applications of deep learning. intel is looking to diversify from its longtime stronghold in chips for personal computers, a market that has been slowing lately. mr. krzanich has been pushing the company into new fields, including wearable technology, drones and other connected devices known by the phrase the internet of things, or iot. he predicted deep learning will become much more widely used -- not just in data centers, but to sift through the information generated by connected devices. \"without some form of artificial intelligence,\" such devices will only generate noise, mr. krzanich said. intel also announced a relationship with google to collaborate on software and other technology for the search firm\\'s cloud

sophisticated models for a number of financial applications. however, even when those models produce good results, it's not always clear how the models arrived at them. this makes them something of a black box, which isn't useful for highly regulated industries like banking. the fact is, we haven't had the ability to use some of the most advanced deep learning models because of the explainability

credit applications, that isn't enough.douglas merrill, ceo of zestfinance, said the company's approach draws heavily from an open-source technique called shap  which is based on game theory work done in the1970s by mathematician lloyd shapley. that work has since been used by ai researchers to find transparent ways to determine how algorithms make decisions. what zest does is to take that technique and apply it to financial underwriting so financial institutions can understand why the machine learning model said yes to one credit application and no to another. our version is designed to satisfy the regulatory and risk management requirements in financial services, merrill says. the startup has believers. in 2017, ford partnered with zest to improve credit risk modeling for auto

is making madison avenue look more like wall street. the combination of omnicom group of the u.s. and france\\'s publicis groupe sa is aimed at restoring the balance of power between advertising agencies and such silicon valley companies as google inc. and facebook inc. about 22% of global ad spending now is digital, according to emarketer, a share projected to grow to 27% by 2017. omnicom and publicis hope that by joining forces, they will be better equipped for an industry increasingly dominated by data-driven analysis and automated trading of ad space.  the market for automated buying of space is relatively small, but fast growing. according to emarketer, u.s.advertisers will spend $3.4 billion on real-time bidding in 2013, mostly in online display ads.\"digital buying of media is done by machines, as if you\\'re standing on the floor of the nasdaq as opposed to traditional media shop,\" omnicom\\'s chief executive, john wren, told analysts earlier this month. \"i hold the long-term belief that eventually traditional media, or a lot of traditional media, will get purchased that way.\" mr. wren and publicis chief executive maurice levy are to be co-ceos for 30 months, after which mr. levy, who initiated the talks, is slated to become non executive chairman and mr. wren to continue as ceo, the companies said. mr. levy is 71 years old and mr. wren is 60.to be called publicis omnicom group, the new company would have combined revenue of nearly $23 billion, based on 2012 figures for each, overtaking wpp group plc\\'s gbp 10.37 billion ($15.95 billion) revenue posted last year. the merger partners\\' combined stock market value as of friday was $35.1 billion. the hope is to close the deal in the fourth quarter of 2013 or first quarter of 2014, though it could face antitrust scrutiny. the combination would bring some of madison avenue\\'s best-known advertising agencies under one roof. omnicom, whose agencies include bbdo, tbwa worldwide and media buyer omd, works for advertisers such as mcdonald\\'s corp. and pepsico inc. publicis owns leo burnett and saatchi & saatchi as well as media-buying firm starcom mediavest and digital agencies such as razorfish. its clients include l\\'oreal sa, procter & gamble co. and renault sa. of the growing portion of global ad spending that is digital, the money flows disproportionately to google, which not only sells online search ads but runs an automated marketplace for buying online ads, and to facebook, which has a vast audience and plenty of user data. with revenue three times that of wpp last year, google is a formidable competitor for ad agencies, particularly in an industry where data collection has assumed greater importance. firms such as salesforce.com and adobe systems inc. are also moving more deeply into the industry, posing new competition for ad agencies. \"all of these tech players didn\\'t exist, didn\\'t compete, even on the fringes of our business, even five years ago,\" omnicom\\'s mr. wren said in an interview. the merger, he said, will \"create a lot of opportunities for us, some defensive and some offensive.\"advertisers use data to better aim their ads at certain demographic groups, taking into account people\\'sinternet surfing behavior or purchasing habits. to do this efficiently requires access to huge amounts of data, where google has a head start.\"it\\'s trillions of data that we have to crunch down in order to go down to very small segments or clusters of thepopulation to deliver some single messages to very the population of

dramatic changes in recent year landscape has the exponential development of new mediagiants, the explosion of big data, blurring of media giants all players and profound changes in consumerbehavior.\"he said the partners hope their com consumer behavior fit clients \"by bringing together the most comprehensiveoffering of analog and digital services.comprehensive offerings with rbc capital markets, said, \"the bigger an ad agency is, the more likely they are to have more access to consumer data and data around the pricing of online ad impressions,\" which helps them get the best price when buying from \"digital behemoths like google and facebook.\"meanwhile, an increasing portion of ads is being bought and sold on automated exchanges, known as\"programmatic buying,\" rather than through madison avenue media-buying firms that rely on relationships between media sales executives and ad buyers. while ad firms have set up their own automated trading desks, they face lots of competition. some advertisers, such as kellogg co., use independent providers instead of agency-owned trading desks. alternatively, advertisers can go straight to google, which owns doubleclick bid manager -- previously calledinvite media -- a system that allows advertisers to buy ad space across the web. to compete, ad companies have invested heavily in building systems that play in this arena and data that help improve their buying. maintaining and updating the systems can be expensive.\"with an integrated data and automated buying operation, the combined scale of publicis and omnicom would be better-positioned to compete against traditional agency competitors as well as nontraditional competitors like google,\" said rajeev goel, ceo at pubmatic inc., a tech company that helps website owners manage and sell ad space. data analysis is even playing a role in shaping of ads themselves. last year, samsung electronics co. minedtwitter for critical comments about the launch of apple inc.\\'s new iphone and used them to shape its ads. all the major ad-agency holding companies in recent years have been snapping up data scientists and engineers.\"there has been a huge shift in the way we do business,\" said jonathan nelson, chief executive ofomnicom\\'s digital business, in a recent interview. \"we are borrowing black-box trading techniques out of wallstreet; we are looking at genetic algorithms; we are looking at artificial intelligence; we are looking at predictive models; we are looking for anything that might give marketers an edge.\"in january, omnicom hired amit bhattacharyya as a data scientist at its data and analytics company, annalect. his background includes helping build a particle detector on a nasa-funded experiment during graduate studies and working as a quantitative analyst on wall street.\"when i was young, i thought i\\'d be an astronaut or a physics professor,\" he said. he was drawn to advertising by the bigger role played by data. the annalect unit has about 200 data scientists and programmers on staff, omnicom says. publicis also has hired many of these types of experts. the deal comes as companies increasingly squeeze down their costs for ad services, in some cases by delaying payments to agencies. the merger could give the ad companies more power to fight back.\"this consolidation could be favorable for profit margins at the holding companies because it reduces the competition when services are priced for clients,\" said brian wieser, of pivotal research group', 'onsemiconductor ,

creator of the world\\'s first operating system for artificial intelligence,aiware(tm), today announced an agreement with art19, a leading podcast hosting, content management, monetization, and measurement platform. art19 will use aiware to run cognitive analysis and topical extraction on publisher podcasts that are part of art19\\'s targeted ad sales platform, making it possible forart19\\'s advertising partners to target ads based on the content of an individual podcast episode.\"art19 knows podcast advertising works. and advertisers know that ads can be incredibly successful if they\\'re reaching the right listeners at the right time,\" said lex friedman, chief revenue officer at art19. \"by adding aiware to our platform, we\\'re empowering buyers to target ads to consumers based on the content of the episode they\\'re listening to. listeners appreciate contextual and relevant ads -- and that means they pay more attention to them.\"art19 will integrate aiware\\'s transcription and topic analysis capabilities to enhance its targeted marketplace. the art19 sales team will then be able to place contextually relevant advertisements within the podcast based on its subject matter. programmatic digital audio ad serving generally allows advertisers to reach users based on a combination of targetable attributes derived from first-party and third-party user data. art19 will use aiware to identify the topics discussed in a podcast episode, enabling the digital audio ad server to target or exclude ads based not only on who is listening to the content, but on the topical taxonomy of that content. now, for example, a financial services firm can target ads to be played in podcast episodes that are discussing personal finance and are being listened to by 25- to34-year-olds. conversely, aiware can also support brand safety use cases, in which an advertiser requests that its ads be excluded from any podcast episodes that discuss controversial topics. before aiware, there was no way for art19\\'s employees to analyze and categorize topical metadata efficiently across thousands of podcast episodes. now, with aiware\\'s topical extraction capabilities, art19can automate this workflow and pass the metadata to the ad server, which will automatically include or exclude ads based on rule sets.\"we\\'re always looking for powerful tools that benefit everyone in our ecosystem to keep pushing podcasting forward -- for publishers, advertisers, and listeners alike,\" friedman added. \"aiware will lead to contextually relevant ads, which will serve publishers well in terms of revenue; yield great results for advertisers; and provide listeners with ads that feel native, custom, and in line with their interests.\"unlike a single-point solution that solves only one use case, aiware affords art19 a true ai operating system that makes its investment in ai future-proof. the aiware platform\\'s open architecture allows art19to integrate cognition from multiple machine learning algorithms into its existing technology stack seamlessly and to add more cognitive categories easily as new needs arise. aiware enables ad-tech capabilities within audio and video formats that were previously impractical because they exceeded the capacity and financial resources of human workforces. in a parallel to google\\'sindexing of websites, veritone\\'s aiware automates the systematic indexing and contextual extraction of hundreds of thousands of hours of audio and video content to enable new targeting and brand safety workflows,\" said

jointly announced a partnership that will position and deliver effective cost management for governments and enterprises in the region. the partnership will launch a cloud-based, advanced e-procurement system that extends the capabilities of existing procure-to-pay products, into business planning and improving interaction between buyers and their suppliers.cloudbuy is an integrated solution that takes a corporate buyer through a procurement process, from sourcing, order placement, payment, through to analyzing the purchase from a cost management standpoint, in a few mouse clicks. the solution then takes the process further with in-built controls and immediate audit facilities, eliminating rogue buying and off-contract pricing as well as ensuring compliance.cloudbuy has an exclusive partnership with visa, which offers a safe and controlled payment environment. the payment method also ensures that buyer organizations do not lapse on payment schedules with their suppliers and that suppliers have better cash flow with shorter payment periods. the payment method will particularly benefit sme suppliers who often suffer cash flow problems because of payment delays by buyers.\"economic forecasts in asia pacific markets, particularly the more developed ones, have called for austerity measures. we acknowledge that organizations are under pressure to cut costs and improve efficiencies quickly. they are looking for solutions that are not just quick fixes but provide sustainable cost management possibilities,\" said olivia leong, regional head of enterprise & government payment solutions, commercialproducts, visa, asia pacific, central europe, middle east and africa.\"we decided to extend visa\\'s collaboration with @ukplc that started in europe, to asia pacific. throughcloudbuy, we bring to market an enhanced electronic procure-to-pay solution that doesn\\'t just provide immediate cost savings, but will push companies to reassess their buying behaviors and payment methods to meet long-term cost management objectives,\" leong added. visa says that the partnership combines the strengths of the company\\'s issuer relationships, a proven network and a track record of bringing innovative payment solutions to the market, with @ukplc\\'s experience in developing and running e-commerce and cloud computing solutions for government and corporate clients.cloudbuy -- going beyond procure-to-paya key differentiator of cloudbuy is its starting point. the system operates on artificial intelligence technology that analyses a buying organization\\'s spend detail in just days. it gives an immediate assessment of compliance to raising purchase orders, price variances for the same product across the organization locally and globally, lost opportunities with volume discounts and special promotions, as well as a global price benchmark for the same product. the data and analysis will assist buying organizations to set realistic cost management targets even before cloudbuy is implemented. upon implementation, cloudbuy continues to offer data analysis that produces extensive reports that assist organizations with supplier management, contract negotiations and renegotiations, as well as real time tracking of cost management leading to better business forecasting.\"we have at hand the intelligence of having analyzed more than $500 billion of spend through ourspendinsight tool,\" said lyn duncan, ceo, ukplc. \"cloudbuy\\'s client base will benefit from the knowledge gained from @ukplc\\'s experience in analyzing corporate buying behavior as well as price variances across the globe. we remain steadfastly committed to helping organizations improve purchasing processes and achieving their strategic business goals.\"working with visa, we have been challenged to bring to market a technological solution that is easy to implement and use. buying organizations need not deal with high up-front investments and complicated set-up procedures. there will be a minimum training requirement for administrators and users.\"using the system is intuitive as it has been modeled to be an ecommerce site for corporate purchases. so anyone who is capable of online shopping through an amazon.com or travelocity will breeze throughcloudbuy. this ensures that the adoption rate is higher and organizations will see the benefits of implementation much faster,\" said duncan.cloudbuy for suppliersanother e-commerce influence that buyers can see on cloudbuy is its catalogue management system. typically in e-procurement systems, catalogue management resides with buying organizations that have to manually load suppliers\\' spreadsheet catalogues into their portals. this results in extra work for buyers and suppliers as well as out-of-date content and a limited ability to deal with services and more complex products.cloudbuy enables suppliers to manage their own content. suppliers are provided with a b2b website which enables them to manage their catalogue of goods or services, time based booking, pricing and discount structures, inform buyers of delivery charges, stock levels, as well as tax and currency. if suppliers maintain their own websites, cloudbuy can work with them to make those sites interoperable with the buyer\\'s cloudbuyportal.this is a significant step forward from a supplier standpoint as the website structure allows for them to promote their products and services at the right price, ensuring availability, and eliminating hidden costs for buyers, significantly reducing the possibility of disagreement on final purchase prices.cloudbuy will be first launched in australia in late 2013. other markets earmarked for first phase launch include new zealand, singapore and

standalone entity, and we\\'ll also be working on some exciting new projects that we can\\'t talk about just yet.\"wander had raised $1.2 million in april 2012. the app was launched to give a tumblr experience to the users by clicking photos and make content swiftly. it gamifies the photo experience with the help of gifs which can act as a feed or slideshow of images to describe your day. at first look, the app seems to be a good engagement tool for celebrities and brands justified by the craze in people to know how they spend their day (through images). in general, it cuts down on a lot of irrelevant content used to share an experience through blogs as images can connect to the audience more than the content. wander creates a wanderlog, which is where one can capture experiences like adventures, a guide to a town, favorite works of street art or simply the places one loves. this in turns helps to make a network connecting places, posts and experiences bringing together wanderers with shared interests. what yahoo! gets from the deal with instagram and snapchat, photo content is on the rise and wander has as a team behind an app, which gives yahoo! an insight into how people spend their day through the medium of photographs clicked throughout the day. besides talent acquisition, this deal will support the artificial intelligence study with the data on human interactions. acquisition of aviate and wander are in sync with marissa mayer\\'s announcement in the beginning of this year, \"think about how much your phone understands about you - your contacts, calendar,

compete against pandora, beats music, iheartradio, rdio and other services, the stockholm-based music streaming giant has acquired the echo nest corp. the deal is the culmination of a more than three-year relationship between somerville, massachusetts-basedecho nest and spotify, which is considered an ipo candidate. echo nest technology blends machine learning and natural language processing--the respective expertise of co-founders and mit doctorates tristan jehan and brian whitman--to build a database of songs and artists. the recommendation engine recognizes pitches, tempos and other similarities between songs and blends that data with a cultural understanding of songs and artists gleaned from blogs, music reviews and other online sources. the result: a recommendation engine that recognizes the meaning of lyrics in a norwegian death metal ditty and knows they would not be appreciated by christian music fans despite similarities in the syncopation. the echo nest engine has some similarities to the service offered by pandora, with one major distinction: other streaming music sites can, and have been, licensing echo nest technology as the personalization brain powering their operations for the past few years. spotify officially integrated the echo nest technology with its spotify radio app in 2011.\"we basically sell them pandora in a box,\" said echo nest board member and matrix partners generalpartner antonio rodriguez, noting that a number of large echo nest customers keep their identities private.\"they [streaming services] could try and develop this technology over several years or just buy it. it\\'s a real revenue business.\"in announcing the deal on their respective company blogs, echo nest and spotify each wrote that echonest\\'s api would remain available to developers for free. neither company mentioned what impact the deal would have on rdio, iheartradio and other echo nest customers. neither company responded to a request for additional comment.mr. rodriguez, whose firm began investing in echo nest in 2010, declined to share terms of the acquisition, other than to say it was a combination of cash and stock. founded in 2005 and employing 70, echo nest has raised roughly $25 million from norwest venturepartners, matrix partners and commonwealth capital. echo nest will maintain its 70-person team in massachusetts.the wall street journal reported in november that spotify had secured nearly $250 million in new financing, with silicon valley-based technology crossover ventures leading a funding round that valued the

$3.7 billion, a move aimed at accelerating the french ad holding company\\'s digital push. while that\\'s a hefty 44% premium for sapientshareholders, just how much of a game changer will the deal be for publicis? pivotal research analyst brian wieser said the acquisition has limited strategic impact for publicis, which hasn\\'t gained a meaningful edge in growth over its competitors despite its more aggressive push to scoop up big digital marketing firms. while sapient\\'s sapientnitro agency offers world-class digital marketing capabilities, mr. wieser in a research note monday said those offerings \"are not sufficiently unique to offer meaningful strategic benefits for publicis.\" additionally, the deal \"would make it harder for publicis to pursue something that might actually be \\'transformative\\' in the future, \"mr. wieser notes, adding that sapient \"would make a publicis acquisition of interpublic much more unlikely than it already appears presently.\"alfred fried analyst richard tullo in a note described the sapient deal as \"convoluted\" for publicis, as sapient derives about two-thirds of its revenue from digital advertising and the rest from industrial artificial intelligence and government services. he added that the \"cultural fit should be ok,\" since publicis already owns similar digital agencies such as digitas and rosetta. meanwhile, natixis analysts said the deal clarifies that \"publicis is positioning itself in the area of digital services rather than technology.\"publicis chief executive acknowledged in a conference call earlier monday that adding sapient\\'s consulting and technology services to its mix will help the company better deal with clients who are increasingly focused on reaching consumers through social media and e-commerce platforms. the sapient deal is a clear signal that publicis is maintaining its position of being a digital services business--unlike its rival wpp, which has taken a different route in adapting to the changing competitive landscape by going deep in ad technology. wpp, for example, recently invested $25 million in appnexus, whose technology is used in automated ad buying. publicis just six months ago walked away from a $35-billion plan to merge with rival omnicom, a deal that would have created the world\\'s largest ad holding company by revenue. publicis\\' chief executive mauricelevy has attributed the company\\'s weak results in recent quarters to distractions related to the failed deal and has emphasized his goal to transform publicis into a digital company. according to the company\\'s most recent earnings report, digital made up roughly 42% of publicis\\' revenue so far this year compared with 38%in the year-earlier period. publicis investors are weighing what the deal might mean for shareholder return: shares were down more than 2% so far today.', 'ibm\\'s acquisition of iris analytics brings new machine learning-powered fraud detection to the ibm portfolio.ibm today announced that it has acquired iris analytics, a privately held company specializing in real-time analytics to help combat payment fraud.based in koblenz, germany, iris offers a real-time fraud analytics engine that uses machine learning to generate rapid anti-fraud models. it also simultaneously supports the creation and modification of ad-hoc models proven successful on various sized payment platforms, ibm said.financial terms of the deal to acquire iris analytics were not disclosed. iris analytics is ibm\\'s first acquisition of 2016.the iris technology acts as a virtual analyst to help identify new fraud patterns, and it applies machine learning models to help analysts detect fraud and act quickly to help reduce fraudulent events, the company said. iris bridges the gap between expert-driven rules and traditional predictive modeling by applying artificial intelligence and cognitive techniques to partner with human experts in suggesting best- fit analytics interactively. the company s technology also allows for testing and deploying models with real production data, as it happens and without downtime.\"the cognitive computing approach unleashes a new paradigm in fighting fraud,\" said alistair rennie, general manager, industry solutions & offering management, ibm. \"the combination of iris analytics with ibm\\'scounter fraud technology will help organizations more accurately detect fraud at scale and speed so that they are in a position to implement countermeasures quickly, with more control and transparency, while at the same time assists with dramatically lowering false positives.\"big blue said only 16 percent of banks polled in a recent global ibm institute of business value study said they could detect fraud as it is attempted. the study also showed that once new schemes were identified and confirmed, it is estimated that countermeasures typically require longer than four weeks to deploy. existing fraud detection techniques are constrained by the dependency on specialized black box models that are hard to understand, explain, and adapt, ibm said. moreover, as the payments industry continues to evolve with faster, alternative and mobile payments innovations and the expanding use of chip and pin systems, fraudsters have become more technologically sophisticated and organized, adapting their fraud techniques more quickly to attack the new systems. according to ibm, iris is in use by leading banks and payment processors throughout the world. for example, the french payment card switch: e-rsb, operated by stet, uses iris for 5.5 billion annual credit and debit card transactions. \"with an average response time of less than five milliseconds per transaction even during peak periods when we are processing over 750 transactions per second, iris enables us to detect potential fraud without adding any notable overhead to our service, said pierre juhen, deputy ceo of stet. in addition, stet has been able to respond to newly identified fraud patterns by deploying new counter measures in a few hours without taking down the system, he said. defenses against financial crime are in critical need of innovation and improvement. as the payments industry evolves with new payments methods such as chip and pin, mobile payments and immediate payments, the ability for financial institutions to accurately make decisions about what is suspicious and what is legitimate before the payment is executed is required, said constantin von altrock, ceo of iris

additive manufacturing capabilities in the xcelerator portfolio of software.sunata(tm) software uses thermal distortion analysis to provide a simple, automated way to optimize part build orientation and generate support structures. this approach allows the designer--rather than the analyst--to perform these simulations, thereby reducing the downstream analysis that needs to be conducted via

design-for-additive process, as well as companies who have yet to start their additive manufacturing journey.\"the high rate of 3d print failures is a key challenge companies face in leveraging additive manufacturing for high-volume production. parts often need to go through several design and analysis iterations before the optimal build orientation and support structures are determined. typically, designers don\\'t have the capabilities to consider such factors as part orientation, distortion, and heat extraction uniformity in their design. this puts the onus on engineering specialists to resolve such issues. atlas 3d\\'s sunata software solves this problem by giving front-end designers a quick, easy and automated way to get much closer to a \"right first time\" build.

assistants and redesigning customer interactions to using conversational assistants to help employees communicate and work better together. according to gartner, by 2020, conversational artificial intelligence will be a supported user experience for more than 50 percent of large, consumer-centric enterprises. at microsoft, we envision a world where natural language becomes the new user interface, enabling people to do more with what they say, type and input, understanding preferences and tasks and modeling experiences based on the way people think and remember.today, we are announcing we have signed an agreement to acquire xoxco, a software product design and development studio known for its conversational ai and bot development capabilities. the company has been paving the way in conversational ai since 2013 and was responsible for the creation of howdy, the first commercially available bot for slack that helps schedule meetings, and botkit, which provides the development tools used by hundreds of thousands of developers on github. over the years, we have partnered with xoxco and have been inspired by this work.we have shared goals to foster a community of startups and innovators, share best practices and continue to amplify our focus on conversational ai, as well as to develop tools for empowering people to create experiences that do more with speech and language.the microsoft bot framework, available as a service in azure and on github, supports over 360,000developers today. with this acquisition, we are continuing to realize our approach of democratizing ai development, conversation and dialog, and integrating conversational experiences where people communicate.over the last six months, microsoft has made several strategic acquisitions to accelerate the pace of ai development. the acquisition of semantic machines in may brought a revolutionary new approach to conversational ai. in july, we acquired bonsai to help reduce the barriers to ai development by combining machine teaching, reinforcement learning and simulation. in september, we acquired lobe, a company that has created a simple visual interface empowering anyone to develop and apply deep learning and ai models quickly, without writing code. the acquisition of github in october demonstrates our belief in the power of communities to help fuel the next wave of bot development.our goal is to make ai accessible and valuable to every individual and organization, amplifying human ingenuity with intelligent technology. to do this, microsoft is infusing intelligence across all its products and services to extend individuals and organizations capabilities and make them more productive, providing a powerful platform of ai services and tools that makes innovation by developers and partners faster and more accessible, and helping transform business by enabling breakthroughs to current approaches and entirely new scenarios that leverage the power of intelligent technology.were excited to welcome the xoxco team and look forward to working with the community to accelerate innovation and help customers capitalize on the many benefits ai can offer', 'microsoft msft continues its acquisition spree with the recently announced deal to buy bonsai, an artificial intelligence-based (\"ai\") startup. bonsai develops ai driven technology which improves the functioning of intelligent autonomous systems. the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps. industries which leverage robotics, hvac (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) and other automated systems can benefit a great deal from bonsai`s tech. the tech stalwarts are concentrating on training and taming machines for the required outcomes. facial recognition, self-driving cars, unlock systems, are instances where advanced machine learning (\"ml\") capabilities are extensively required. microsoft is well poised to benefit from the path-breaking technology bonsai brings on board. notably, speculations are rife that the tech power house is working on an automated cashier less check out technology to counter amazon`s amzn amazon go stores. the automated tech of bonsai is expected to aid the company in that project as well. shares of microsoft have returned 47.9% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry\\'s rally of33.5%. this outperformance can primarily be attributed to its rapidly expanding efforts in ai and internet of things (\"iot\") based developments. undisturbed focus on azure remains a key catalyst. focal points of the acquisitionmicrosoft sees a lot of potential of bonsai`s \"reinforcement learning\" skills in industrial ai. the tech giant already boasts of an end-to-end compilation of ai tools microsoft cognitive services. it comprises intelligent apis to ensure developers can easily utilize advanced technologies in their applications. furthermore, gluonopen source interface and open neural network exchange (\"onnx\") format already assist deep learning. microsoft will utilize bonsai capabilities to power its azure ai platform. bonsai`s platform in microsoftresearch will lead to a one-of-a-kind \"ai toolchain\" which is expected to develop \"any kind of autonomous system\" for calibration and control tasks. this toolchain combined with azure machine learning supported by azure cloud will be run on azure iot. consequently, microsoft can develop a comprehensive solution for enhancing, operating and building \"brains\" for autonomous systems. per the company`s blog, autonomous systems in operation are envisioned to grow to approximately 800million by 2025. moreover, boston consulting group data, as revealed by siemens, projects world wide spending in the robotics sector to reach $66.9 billion by 2025, compared with $26.9 billion in 2015. bonsai`saddition to microsoft`s ai portfolio is in sync with the company`s intention to gain from this immense growth. capitalizing on the ai revolution we believe microsoft is on the right track, given its increasing inclination towards ai ever than before. the company`s focus on strengthening presence in the ai market is evident from the acquisition of berkeley, clbased bonsai. notably, in the past month, microsoft acquired semantic machines, which introduced an extensive approach for the development of conversational ai to advance its digital assistant cortana. in 2017, the company acquired ai startup maluuba, an expert in the field of deep learning and reinforcement learning for question-answering and decision-making systems. furthermore, microsoft acquired swiftket, anai startup earlier in 2016 for $250 million. these ai-based startups widen the scale of prospects for the tech giant. the company has also realized the immense power innovative software developers possess and how it can aid the company explore lucrative market opportunities. recent acquisition of github, the world`s largest open-source code repository, for approximately $7.5 billion reinforces the company`s ml initiatives. thegithub-azure integration will further strengthen microsoft`s commitment to cloud-computing future as it aims to compete against the likes of amazon and fellow tech giants. per a recent report by grand view research, the ai market is expected to hit $35.9 billion by 2025 at a cagr of 57.2% with 2017 as the base year. the projected figure takes into account direct revenue sources. given the huge growth prospect in the industry, microsoft is putting its best foot forward to grab a major share of the projected revenue growth. moreover, integration of ai techniques within cortana, office 365 and azurepresents a significant competitive edge to the company, in our view.', 'microsoft went shopping for ai startups and stopped its search at semantic machines, a newton-based startup that builds artificial intelligence software for home-automation devices and customer service for brands. the company also has an office in berkeley, california. its conversational ai software uses machine learning to improve human-computer interaction that will enable computers to comprehend and accomplish tasks efficiently. so what makes semantic machines special? the people. the company boasts of a team that has unique experience with building the core ai technology for siri and google now. the company is led by a strong team of experts from the industry and academia ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x80\\x9d including entrepreneur dan roth and two of the most prominent and innovative natural language ai researchers in the world, uc berkeley professor dan klein and stanford university professor percy liang (who developed the google assistant core ai), as well as former apple chief speech scientist larry gillick. for microsoft, acquiring semantic is in line with its focus on building better speech-recognition software. microsoft has some success with digital assistant cortana, as well as with social chatbots like xiaoice that got a revamp in 2015. although details of the deal were not disclosed, with this acquisition, microsoft plans to set up a conversational ai center of excellence in berkeley, california to develop language interfaces.', 'avigilon, one of canada\\'s tech success stories, was delisted from the toronto stock exchange on monday, as part of the completion of a $1 billion takeover by motorola solutions. based in vancouver, avigilon makes security cameras, access control systems and the software that allows those devices to work smarter and provide more information to users. avigilon president and coo james henderson said the sale, first announced in february, gives avigilon a huge opportunity for growth within motorola, where it is expected to continue operating as its own business unit. motorola is a long way from the company that made flip phones 15 years ago; these days, the company is heavily focused on systems for first responders. they make the command centres for first responders that connect central dispatch with the people in the field. henderson said that avigilon\\'s expertise with video surveillance makes it a natural fit. \"we\\'re bringing to the table the eyes to their ears. you know, they\\'re a leader in voice and becoming a leader in other things,\" he said. \"we are a leader in video - video intelligence, video analytics, and high quality end-to end video solutions.\"avigilon is also deploying deep learning and artificial intelligence software that allows those surveillance cameras to do some incredible things.\"it actually learns what it\\'s looking at, and what is normal,\" henderson said. \"people walking down a street is normal. cars driving down the road is normal. now, all of a sudden if people start running in all directions -something it\\'s never seen before - it can trigger an alarm.\"the systems can also detect attributes like hair colour, sex and clothing colour, which allows operators to look for individuals, searching through video footage coming from dozens, or even hundreds of cameras. by launching a cloud system for operators, avigilon can also update security systems with new features over time. for some who follow the canadian tech industry closely, watching another canadian success story gobbled up by an american company brought a tinge of disappointment.\"i\\'ve heard the rumblings of the disappointment, but to be quite honest, i hear that disappointment from analysts,\" henderson said, with a hint of bemusement, adding that sale provided great value for shareholders. carl rodrigues, ceo and president of soti inc. - a mississauga based enterprise mobility management company - is a vocal advocate for growing canadian startups at home, instead of seeing them sold once they get big enough.\"i think there\\'s a lower bar we set for ourselves,\" rodrigues said.\"i want to build a company that rivals a google or a facebook or a tesla. i don\\'t really understand why canadian ceos

into israel. the messaging app, on which messages and pictures are only accessible for a short time, was very popular with the young generation but not perceived as having any great technological vision. cimagine, a small company from kfar yehoshua that had raised just a few million dollars, developed an augmented reality technology that made it possible to installã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d virtual furniture or other items in a house. the connection between the companies wasnã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢t totally clear then: snap did not elaborate on its plans, and the cimagine acquisition, for an estimated $40 million, was not officially announced. cimagine became snapã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢sisrael research and development center, headed by zak. eleven months ago, snap expanded its presence in israel with the launch of a commercial section, headed by assaf sagy, to work with local advertisers and sell ads. eyal zakofer vakninuntil now, however, snap has kept its israeli activity under the radar. now, for the first time, executives agreed to talk about the challenges they contend with and their search for the next big thing. snapchat has become one of the apps most associated with the young generation. with 186 million daily users, it is far from being an empire on the scale of google or facebook, and has just had a particularly hard year, but it still has tremendous influence on media, social

that are deleted after being sent; stories ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x80\\x9c a series of pictures and videos that are deleted after 24 hours; filters and lenses ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x80\\x9c illustrations and animations

that it owns ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x80\\x9c instagram, facebook messenger and whatsapp. 1.1 billion people now use the stories feature daily on the various facebook platforms. at the beginning of 2016, snap decided to upgrade the appã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s filters, lenses and animation experiences and make them more realistic and more precise (for example, the illustrated dogã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s ears must show up exactly on the userã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s head, and a big tongue should appear when he opens his mouth).to make this happen, it needed to acquire computer vision and ar capabilities. cimagine, founded in 2012by yoni nevo, nir daube, ozi egri and amiram avraham (who did not work in the company), fit the bill. there were companies in the global market that were developing a product similar to ours, but we were always one step ahead of them,ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d says zak, who headed up the development of cimagineã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s mathematical engine at the time. weã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢d gotten to know snap through various conferences and get-togethers. then one day they called and the acquisition process started.ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9dhe adds: snap is a serious company. they checked first to make sure the technology belonged to us and that we really developed it. they made sure we knew what we were talking about that our product really suited their needs.ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9dcimagine ceo nevo headed up development at the time but recently left his position. daube and egri, the engineering and product team, moved to snapã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s los angeles headquarters. the technology developed by cimagine eventually became world lenses, one of snapchatã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s most popular features. based on ar, it enables you to insert amusing virtual images in the world around you. for example, you could

recognition. adding merit to the rumour is another report from israeli financial website calcalist which states that apple has acquired realface, an israeli startup that developed deep learning-based face authentication technology. the terms of the deal aren\\'t public, but it\\'s estimated at \"several million dollars.\" in his report hall says the benefits of facial recognition over fingerprint recognition are that it is widely regarded as being more secure, something banks would prefer as mobile payment services expand; and that it will work well in wet conditions where touch id can be less reliable. the flip side is that facial recognition requires a more deliberate unlocking procedure of holding the phone upto your face which can be inconvenient and may make users more self-conscious than fingerprint unlocking. facial recognition can also be less reliable for users who wear glasses, contact lenses or sunglasses, something the iris scanner in samsung\\'s galaxy note 7 faced. if implemented, the cutting edge technology won\\'t come cheap. hall says the scanner will add $10-15 more to the manufacturing cost of a phone compared to the touch id module currently being used. coupled with the iphone 8\\'s widely reported switch to an oled display and all new chassis, the changes are expected to push the iphone 8\\'s starting price over$1,000', 'one of china\\'s top search engines, baidu, has acquired a y combinator-backed startup and the company\\'s answer to competing with google home and amazon echo. terms of the deal were not disclosed. raven tech, with total equity

it will aid with the companyã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93hardware efforts and ambient computing future,ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d according to osterloh.in a separate blog post, northã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s co-founders stephen lake, matthew bailey and aaron grant discuss their perspective on the acquisition. they say the deal makes sense because it will help ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93significantly advance our shared vision,ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d but go on to note that this will mean winding down support for focals 1.0, the first-generation smart glasses product that north released last year, and cancelling any plans to ship focals 2.0, the second-generation version that the company had been teasing and preparing to release over the last several months.focals received significant media attention following their release, and provided the most consumer-friendly wearable-glasses-computing-interface ever launched. they closely resembled regular optical glasses, albeit with larger arms to house the active computing components, and projected a transparent display overlay onto one frame which showed things like messages and navigation directions.around the focals 1.0 debut, north co-founder and ceo stephen lake told me that the company had originally begun developing its debut product, the myo gesture control armband, to create a way to interact naturally with the ambient smart computing platforms of the future. myo read electrical pulses generated by the body when you move your arm, and translated that into computer input. after realizing that devices it was designed to work with, including vr headsets and wearable computers like google glass, werenã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢t far enough along for its novel control paradigm to take off, they shifted to addressing the root of the problem with focals. focals had some major limitations, however, including initially requiring that anyone wanting to purchase them go into a physical location for fitting, and then return for adjustments once they were ready. they were also quite expensive, and didnã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢t support the full range of prescriptions needed by many existing glasses-wearers. software limitations, including limited access to appleã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s imessage platform, also hampered the experience for apple mobile device users. north (and myo before it) always employed talented and remarkable mechanical electronics engineers sourced from the nearby university of waterloo, but its ideas typically failed to attract the kind of consumer interest that wouldã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢ve been required for sustained independent operation. the company had raised nearly$200 million in funding since its founding; as mentioned, no word on the total amount google paid, but it doesnã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢t seem likely to have been a blockbuster exit. in an email to north customers, the company also said it would be refunding the full amount paid for any focals purchases ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x80\\x9d likely to defray any complaints about the end of software support, which occurs relatively soon, on july 31, 2020', \"paris-based sentelis specialises in it consulting services, including automation,robotisation, cloud and data management

london, big data partnership was founded in 2012 and has a practice in big-data software, including apache hadoop. it has customers in the u.k., europe and china. big data partnership had raised 4.35 million pounds ($5.69 million)from investors including the private-equity firm beringea. teradata is up against amazon web services, whoseã\\x82â\\xa0first-quarterã\\x82â\\xa0revenue of $2.57 billion topped teradata's entire annual revenue for 2015. earlier this month, teradata's sharesã\\x82â\\xa0were downgradedã\\x82â\\xa0by clsa from buy to underperform on concerns that open source software and cloud-based alternatives to data warehousing (i.e. data warehousing as a service) were hurting teradata's core business, according to barron's. big data partnership will join teradata's think big

server.ã\\x82â\\xa0salesforceã\\x82â\\xa0ã\\x82â\\xa0plans to use some of the tech to build out salesforceã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s own machine learning capabilities as part of salesforceiq, both in-house as well as in products for salesforce customers, the startupã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s ceo and co-founder simon chan said in aã\\x82â\\xa0blog post announcing the acquisition. but the company will also continue to serve third-party developers, he added. a salesforce spokesperson has also confirmed the acquisition but without further elaboration. ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93salesforce has signed a definitive agreement to

transaction closes. you can think of predictionio as mysql for machine learning, as steve described it when the startup announced aã\\x82â\\xa0$2.5 million seed round in 2014. the companyã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s tech, as an open source and essentially free product, makes it more affordable and faster for developers to build machine learning-based products like recommendation or prediction engines.ã\\x82â\\xa0originally called tappingstoneã\\x82â\\xa0when it was founded in 2012 in london, the startup at first had built a product that it described as ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93machine learning as a serviceã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d before pivoting to an open source model. aunder that new direction, the company had developed some traction, with some 8,000 developers and 400 apps powered by its technology. as a point of reference, thatã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s double the number of developers in the community as of 2014. two things will be happening post-acquisition, chan says. first, predictionioã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s tech will remain open source and free to use, while the team works on ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93evolving the project into a self-sustaining community.ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d as part of that the predictionio cluster software on aws cloudformation will come down to $0. there is no word on whether salesforce will plan to develop and support a paid enterprise edition of the product down the line. second, predictionio will be put to work at a very large, specific company: salesforce itself. specifically, it will become a part of salesforceiqã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s machine learning capabilities to ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93enhance intelligence across the salesforce clouds.ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93being a part of salesforce will give us an amazing opportunity to continue building our open source machine learning platform on a much larger scale,ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d chan writes', 'salesforceã\\x82â\\xa0has acquiredã\\x82â\\xa0minhash, techcrunch has learned. salesforce confirmed to us that it has acquired the young startup based in palo alto co-founded by two data science engineers formerly with ebay and avaya.ã\\x82â\\xa0minhashã\\x82â\\xa0had developed an ai platform as well as a ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93personal assistantã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d called aila to crawl to and from the many corners of the internet, pull out relevant trends for marketers, and help them construct campaigns around those trends. salesforce could be making this acquisition to build out its big-data analytics for marketers, but it isnã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢t sharing the details of what the minhash team will be working

companyã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s search and data science teams. that could include features like tracking user behavior and creating interest graphs for particular audiences; clustering algorithms to target ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93lookalikeã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d audiences; and scanning of sources surfacing trending keywords and other signals automatically and doing it with continuity with a companyã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s existing (and other companyã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s existing) campaigns and what ever other information that you feed to it. perhaps most eye-catchingly, minhashã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s team designed the whole product around aila, its own ai-based character who customized everything based on the person using it. ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93weã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢re excited to share the news that the minhash team is joining salesforce,ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d the note on minhashã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s site says. ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93at salesforce, we will continue to pursue our passion for search, data science and machine learning on a much broader scale.ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d weã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢ve reached out to salesforce for more detail on the purchase beyond a generic statement from a spokesperson that simply said: ã¢â\\x82¬å\\x93we can confirm the minhash team is joining salesforce.ã¢â\\x82¬â\\x9d this is salesforceã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s 34th acquisition and follows several others in the wider area of big data analytics, including

international, the birthplace of the voice-powered (and apple-acquired) assistant siri. whenã\\x82â\\xa0tempo launched two years ago, founder and ceo raj singh pitched it as another type of assistant

parking lots or call an uber), bring up social media posts from everyone invited and read related emails and documents. if itã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s a conference call, i can also join the call with one tap (a small touch, but one that makes dialing long conference pass codes much more bearable). in an announcement on the tempo website, the startup says: we started tempo to build an assistant for the mobile business professional. the calendar was the perfect interface, since itã¢â\\x82¬â\\x84¢s the beat of our professional lives. with tempo, we created a smart calendar, using artificial

microsoft, revealed the acquisition on the microsoft blog. he said it will help microsoft bolster the extent to which productivity and behavioural data collected through office 365 and office graph can prioritise time and resources.\"by harnessing this data - while maintaining strict privacy controls - customers can create personalised feedback loops that help people answer questions like: how

wrote. jha explained that analysis of such data can help workers to be more effective with time and resources.\"even small improvements in a person\\'s day-to-day effectiveness can add up to significant value for an organisation and greater employee happiness. today, most of us don\\'t have the tools and information to help us make better decisions about our scarcest resource at work: our time,\" he said.\"giving people access to real data and objective, personalised feedback can lead to a virtuous cycle of improvement for individuals and their company.\"microsoft had not revealed the
