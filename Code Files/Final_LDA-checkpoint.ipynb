industrial ecosystem. simulation technology is no longer solely used by engineers to design better products and reduce the costs of physical testing. leading organizations are expanding the use of simulation into operations by creating digital twins - virtual representations of individual operating assets whose performance and productivity can be improved dynamically through simulation technology. coupling the rich sensor data from increasingly smart industrial equipment with the predictive power of simulation, specific operating conditions can be analyzed and failure points predicted, unlocking billions of dollars in production and maintenance optimization. digital twins can live with the asset, providing a dynamic self-teaching model used to optimize its performance in conjunction with an industrial internet of things (iiot) platform. this combination of machine learning, coupled with physics-based modeling, enables organizations to see how their products performed in the past and predict the future simultaneously. using ansys to create model-based digital twins will provide a foundation to scaling the benefits of the iiot. this is no longer a theoretic concept as ansys and ge global research are already demonstrating actual implementation of digital twins, like the guardeon molded case circuit breaker, a powerful low-voltage circuit breaker designed for

monitor personal health and fitness data -- with the iphone 6 in 2014. it also worked with hospitals and doctors to create a research-tracking app for common diseases like parkinson\\'s and breast cancer, and allowed anyone to become an organ donor using an iphone. the company may have also acquired the machine learning platform turi for $200 million earlier this month. apple isn\\'t alone in pursuing ai for medicine. google announced plans to use artificial intelligence to recognize the signs of common eye diseases using medical records of 1. 6 million patients in london hospitals. despite google, facebook and other companies\\' early ventures into artificial intelligence, apple ceo timcook said apple led the industry in artificial intelligence with voice-controlled personal assistance siri, released in 2011, and isn\\'t stopping anytime soon.\"(the) level of performance (in smartphones) is going to skyrocket\" with coming leaps in artificial intelligence,cook said in an interview with the washington post. \"and there is nothing that\\'s going to replace it in the short term or in the intermediate term, either.â\\xa0', 'in a move designed to compete more closely with google\\' android platform, apple, is buying mobile application developer siri for its technology that lets users perform voice-activated web searches from their smartphones. siri, a start-up based in san jose, makes a voice recognition and search application it describes as a virtual personal assistant, and began offering it for the iphone this year. users speak commands, and the application translates and uses search algorithms to find the answers. siri partnered with companies including citysearch, opentable, and taxi magic to get results. for the latest apple tablet news, opinion and conversation, be sure to check out information week\\'s  special report:  tablet wars -- can apple three-peat? siri had raised a total of $24 million from investors prior to its sale to apple, including menlo ventures and lika-shing, a chinese billionaire who has also invested in facebook. the acquisition agreement has been signed but the deal hasn\\'t closed yet, according to shawn carolan, a managing director at menlo ventures. carolan, who sits on siri\\'s board, said the apple offer \"had to be very compelling\" for the executive team and the board to accept. he declined to disclose the terms. industry observers believe apple will at some point want to offer an alternative to google\\'s search service on the iphone, the ipod touch and the ipad. google has invested heavily in voice command search, location-based search and advertising and in visual recognition search. siri\\'s management team includes artificial intelligence experts, and the product grew out of the sri cognitive assistant that learns and organizes (calo) project, the largest artificial intelligence project in the u.s.,funded with $150 million from darpa, the u.s. defense advanced research projects agency. for siri, the apple acquisition means the start-up will be able to scale its application. right now, siri is built forthe iphone 3gs and the ipod touch and works only in the u.s. with apple\\'s support, siri will be able to push its application to other devices and expand outside the u.s.apple ceo steve jobs began describing his company as a mobile devices maker this year, and in recent months has increased the number of acquisitions in order to add technologies and features to its gadgets.the cupertino-based apple competes with research in motion\\'s blackberry and devices running google\\'ssoftware in smartphones, a segment that\\'s outpacing the rest of the handset market. apple spokesman steve dowling said that apple \"buys smaller technology companies from time to

intelligence startup ayasdi inc to automate some of its compliance processes in a bid to become more efficient. the banking group is implementing the company\\'s ai technology to automate anti-money-laundering investigations that have traditionally been conducted by thousands of humans, the bank\\'s chief operating officer andy maguire said in an interview last week. the vast majority of anti-money-laundering investigations at banks do not find suspicious activity, resulting ina waste of resources, according to the startup. in a pilot of ayasdi\\'s technology, hsbc saw the number of investigations drop by 20 percent without reducing the number of cases referred for more scrutiny, according to the startup.\"it\\'s a win-win,\" maguire said. \"we reduce risks and it costs less money.\"banks have been ramping up their use of ai and automation over the past year to save money and time on cumbersome and manual processes ranging from compliance checks to customer service. at the same time they have been working more closely with young financial technology companies and reducing the amount of technology that gets built in-house. one of the financial technology areas that has seen significant collaboration has been so-called \"regtech\", or technology that can help financial institutions stay compliant with regulations and avoid hefty fines in are as such as money laundering or market manipulation. in 2012 hsbc agreed to pay a $1.92 billion in fines to u.s. authorities for allowing itself to be used to launder  drug money out of mexico and other compliance lapses. to cope with increased regulatory scrutiny and a swathe of new rules, banks went on a compliance hiring spree in the years following the financial crisis.anti-money laundering checks \"is a thing that the whole industry has thrown a lot of bodies at it because that was the way it was being done,\" maguire said.banks have recently started cutting back on compliance hiring as they start deploying new technology that can help automate some of the tasks.  maguire said ai technology can help with compliance because it has the ability \"to do things human beings are not typically good at like high frequency high volume data problems\" or augment human capabilities. ayasdi\\'s executive chairman and co-founder gurjeet singh was in january appointed to hsbc\\'s new technology advisory

over the internet, the titans of technology are stepping up their offerings delivered from data centers afar, so-called cloud computing.i.b.m. made a big move on tuesday, announcing that it had agreed to buy softlayer technologies, a cloud computing company, in an effort to strengthen its position in the fast-growing market. the purchase price was not disclosed. but it was about $2 billion, according to a person told of the negotiations, who has asked not to be named because he had not been authorized to speak publicly about the terms. the acquisition is the largest made under the leadership of virginia m. rometty, who became chief executive in january 2012. the purchase, analysts say, also gives i.b.m. a broader presence in the business of cloud computing services. amazon is the leader in the public cloud arena, and its roster of customers includes not just start-ups and research projects, but also large companies like netflix.amazon does not break out the revenue for its cloud business, amazon web services, but it is growing fast. the unit had estimated revenue of $2 billion last year,  according a recent research report from barclays, which forecast that amazon's cloud business would reach $5 billion or more by 2014.i.b.m. executives say its strategy is to compete in the public cloud market not with basic computing capabilities like processing and storage, but with software for marketing, procurement and customer service delivered as cloud offerings. since 2007, the company has spent $4.5 billion on more than a dozen acquisitions to build up its cloud software and services offerings.''we're focusing on business services that leverage the cloud model,'' said ric telford, vice president fori.b.m. cloud services.i.b.m.'s first moves in the cloud market date to 2007. but its early emphasis, analysts say, had mainly been on so-called private clouds, in which the computing is delivered to users as service over the internet, but from data centers owned by i.b.m.'s corporate customers. but the softlayer acquisition will sharply expand i.b.m.'s capability to deliver computing services remotely to customers from i.b.m. data centers -- the so-called public cloud model.softlayer, a private company based in dallas, has a network of 13 data centers in the united states, singapore and amsterdam, and revenue of about $400 million a year. gi partners, a private equity fund based in menlo park, calif., is the majority owner of softlayer. the softlayer data centers will be added to the 10 cloud services data centers i.b.m. now has worldwide.erich clementi, a senior vice president for i.b.m.'s technology services unit, said softlayer ''completes our portfolio.'' it expands i.b.m.'s public cloud operations, he said, while adding expertise and technology for private clouds and hybrid services, which blend the public and private models.lance crosby, chief executive of softlayer, said his company's long-term goal had been to become ''the defacto and most flexible platform for internet cloud computing. and we couldn't get there on our own.'' i.b.m., he said, has the financial resources and relationships with corporate customers to accelerate the adoption of its cloud technology.beyond the acquisitions, i.b.m. hopes to offer the company's homegrown technology as cloud services, like its watson artificial intelligence software, which i.b.m. announced last month was being tailored as a smart customer service assistant.''watson has a lot more potential because of the cloud delivery model,'' mr. telford said.dannon, the yogurt maker, is a cloud services customer that reflects the i.b.m. strategy. it uses i.b.m. public cloud software for optimizing its pricing, promotions and product planning. the cloud software has helpeddannon's sales planning teams improve the percentage of products sold to consumers to 98 percent from 75percent -- crucial for a food stuff with a limited shelf life. the software was developed by demandtec, whichi.b.m. acquired last year.in new projects, dannon, owned by the french company danone, is now pursuing a ''cloud-first strategy,'' said timothy weaver, the chief information officer.i.b.m. has earmarked its cloud business as an area for investment and growth. that business grew 70percent in the first quarter of 2013 from the quarter a year earlier. by 2015, i.b.m. has forecast that its cloud business should reach $7 billion, including private and public cloud services.all the major technology companies -- including microsoft, emc, hewlett-packard and oracle -- are pursuing cloud strategies. but analysts say i.b.m., perhaps more than any other company, can assure corporate customers to feel comfortable putting their business information in remote data centers and buying public cloud services.more than a decade ago, i.b.m. demonstrated that endorsement effect, when it made a big commitment to linux, the open-source operating system, helping it become a mainstream technology in corporate data centers.''i.b.m. is very much a trusted brand here,'' said steven milunovich, an analyst at ubs securities. ''once they show up, they tend to have a big impact.'\", 'ibm and twitter might seem like unlikely partners. one is the classic button-down business technology company, while the other is the freewheeling hub of online communication in bursts of 140 characters or fewer. but their partnership, announced on wednesday, makes a lot of sense. it is intended to give ibmâ\\x80\\x99sdata-analysis business, including its watson artificial-intelligence technology, broad access to one of the worldâ\\x80\\x99s richest data sources â\\x80\\x94 billions of people expressing their interests, wants

twitterâ\\x80\\x99s unique data asset, will open the door to â\\x80\\x9cbusiness decisions based on the pulse of the planet.â\\x80\\x9dthe ibm and twitter executives announced the partnership at a conference on data analysis hosted by ibmin las vegas. later, in a joint interview, mr. moody and mr. rennie declined to discuss the financial terms of the partnership. but if the companies could achieve their vision of using twitter to improve business decisions spanning everything from marketing to product development, mr. moody said it would be a â\\x80\\x9cgreat revenue opportunityâ\\x80\\x9d for both parties.most twitter messages are public. analysts at ibm and at other companies routinely pore through twitter traffic for early signals of market trends and consumer sentiment on behalf of corporate clients. and twitter has increasingly worked with companies and nonprofit researchers. at the conference, mr. moody mentioned a project with scientists at harvard medical school to study food poisoning by mining twitter messages. he noted that an unnamed manufacturer of commercial fryers, like those used in fast-food restaurants, found that tweets with the phrase â\\x80\\x9csoggy friesâ\\x80\\x9d were an advance sign of equipment malfunctions. twitterâ\\x80\\x99s work with other companies, mr. moody said, will continue. but the ibm partnership, he noted, is in aâ\\x80\\x9cnew category,â\\x80\\x9d given the breadth of the activities.ibm, mr. moody said, will have â\\x80\\x9cfull fidelityâ\\x80\\x9d access to twitter data â\\x80\\x94 all public messages and the archives of past messages. the two companies will also jointly develop software tools tailored to business customers, and ibm will train thousands of its consultants to use twitter data for clients. knowing how to handle twitter data in business, mr. moody noted, is a â\\x80\\x9chuge gapâ\\x80\\x9d for most companies, and the ibm consulting force should help bridge that gap. in the announcement, ibm said it planned first to integrate twitter data in its cloud-based data analysis services, including watson analytics. the two companies will also develop software applications that map customer sentiment for use in sales, marketing and customer service. by incorporating twitter data into its software, ibm, according to mr. rennie, will be able to offer twitter-enhanced products to large numbers of business customers rather than having each one be a start-from-scratch project. with this partnership, twitter is the latest well-known company to join with ibm in recent months in fast-growing fields. ibm teamed up with sap in cloud computing and with apple in data-driven software applications for iphones and ipads.these partnership deals all come in the context of ibmâ\\x80\\x99s seeking growth in promising new businesses faster than those same emerging technologies erode the sales and profits in the companyâ\\x80\\x99s traditional hardware and software lines.

billion in revenue last year. in april, ibm launched the watson health cloud, a trove of more than 315 billion data files, from doctorsâ\\x80\\x99notes and archives of patient medical records to clinical trials and research. the idea is to help doctors and other health care providers find patterns, like how a tumor has changed over time, and determine the best treatment options for their patients. but watsonâ\\x80\\x99s data was limited to text files. buying merge, which helps providers store and exchange medical images such as x-rays and mris that are too large to email easily, would allow watson to â\\x80\\x9cseeâ\\x80\\x9d and add aâ\\x80\\x9cconsiderable inventory in the billionsâ\\x80\\x9d of images, says stephen gold, vice president of watson health.â\\x80\\x9cmerge is right in the sweet spot of medical images and the handling of medical images,â\\x80\\x9d he says. â\\x80\\x9cwhen we looked at what was perhaps one of the most unique opportunities to drive value . . . merge quickly rises to the top.â\\x80\\x9dferro, who rejoined mergeâ\\x80\\x99s board last year as chairman after resigning in 2013, says that he was beginning to build technology with machine-learning capability that would enable merge to not only manage and store images but also read them, helping doctors speed detection and diagnosis. merge, which has roughly 800 employees, has one of the largest nongovernment databases, with 30 billion images. ibmâ\\x80\\x99s supercomputing capabilities, which it is selling to customers on demand under the watson brand in a big-data play,

it\\'sbetting that the next generation of electronics will have interfaces based around things like touch, motion sensing and voice, and it\\'s trying to get ahead of that trend. in april, the company created a $100 million fund to invest in such technologies', 'intel corp. to intensify its efforts in a hot new computing market, is taking the unusual step of relying on technology developed by a startup it acquired.the chip maker, determined to counter rival nvidia corp.\\'s lead in the field known as deep learning, said it would begin shipping chips in 2017 that it acquired through its purchase earlier this year of startup nervanasystems. intel said it plans to integrate nervana chips and software with its general-purpose xeonmicroprocessors, which are used in most corporate data centers. deep learning is a fast-growing branch of the broader field called artificial intelligence, which refers to systems that train themselves by analyzing large sets of data rather than being programmed in conventional ways. companies such as alphabet inc.\\'s google, facebook inc. and microsoft corp. are widely using deep-learning techniques to improve computers\\' ability to identify speech and objects in images, among other tasks. many companies now carry out those chores using a combination of intel xeon chips and nvidia chips called gpus, for graphics processing units. intel, though it didn\\'t mention nvidia by name, said it expects the nervana technology will allow it to train deep-learning systems 100 times faster than with a gpu.\"the gpu architecture does not have a unique advantage for ai,\" said brian krzanich, intel\\'s chief executive, at a san francisco gathering focused on the technology. \"it\\'s not the only solution that is out there.\"intel and others are placing multiple technology bets in the field. besides gpus, companies such as microsoft are also using chips known as field programmable gate arrays, or fpgas, for deep-learning applications. intel jumped on that trend by buying altera corp., the biggest fpga maker, in its biggest-ever transaction. in addition to nervana, intel in september cut a deal to buy movidius ltd., another startup that specializes in vision-related applications of deep learning. intel is looking to diversify from its longtime stronghold in chips for personal computers, a market that has been slowing lately. mr. krzanich has been pushing the company into new fields, including wearable technology, drones and other connected devices known by the phrase the internet of things, or iot. he predicted deep learning will become much more widely used -- not just in data centers, but to sift through the information generated by connected devices. \"without some form of artificial intelligence,\" such devices will only generate noise, mr. krzanich said. intel also announced a relationship with google to collaborate on software and other technology for the search firm\\'s cloud service. patrick moorhead, an

sophisticated models for a number of financial applications. however, even when those models produce good results, it's not always clear how the models arrived at them. this makes them something of a black box, which isn't useful for highly regulated industries like banking. the fact is, we haven't had the ability to use some of the most advanced deep learning models because of the explainability

credit applications, that isn't enough.douglas merrill, ceo of zestfinance, said the company's approach draws heavily from an open-source technique called shap  which is based on game theory work done in the1970s by mathematician lloyd shapley. that work has since been used by ai researchers to find transparent ways to determine how algorithms make decisions. what zest does is to take that technique and apply it to financial underwriting so financial institutions can understand why the machine learning model said yes to one credit application and no to another. our version is designed to satisfy the regulatory and risk management requirements in financial services, merrill says. the startup has believers. in 2017, ford partnered with zest to improve credit risk modeling for auto lending. the company also received a strategic investment of $30 million in 2016 from baidu, giving the company a$252 million valuations, according to pitchbook. that investment was geared towards

decision', 'advertising giants omnicom and publicis said sunday they had agreed to merge, in a $35.1 billion cross-border linkup that shows how big data is making madison avenue look more like wall street. the combination of omnicom group of the u.s. and france\\'s publicis groupe sa is aimed at restoring the balance of power between advertising agencies and such silicon valley companies as google inc. and facebook inc. about 22% of global ad spending now is digital, according to emarketer, a share projected to grow to 27% by 2017. omnicom and publicis hope that by joining forces, they will be better equipped for an industry increasingly dominated by data-driven analysis and automated trading of ad space.  the market for automated buying of space is relatively small, but fast growing. according to emarketer, u.s.advertisers will spend $3.4 billion on real-time bidding in 2013, mostly in online display ads.\"digital buying of media is done by machines, as if you\\'re standing on the floor of the nasdaq as opposed to traditional media shop,\" omnicom\\'s chief executive, john wren, told analysts earlier this month. \"i hold the long-term belief that eventually traditional media, or a lot of traditional media, will get purchased that way.\" mr. wren and publicis chief executive maurice levy are to be co-ceos for 30 months, after which mr. levy, who initiated the talks, is slated to become non executive chairman and mr. wren to continue as ceo, the companies said. mr. levy is 71 years old and mr. wren is 60.to be called publicis omnicom group, the new company would have combined revenue of nearly $23 billion, based on 2012 figures for each, overtaking wpp group plc\\'s gbp 10.37 billion ($15.95 billion) revenue posted last year. the merger partners\\' combined stock market value as of friday was $35.1 billion. the hope is to close the deal in the fourth quarter of 2013 or first quarter of 2014, though it could face antitrust scrutiny. the combination would bring some of madison avenue\\'s best-known advertising agencies under one roof. omnicom, whose agencies include bbdo, tbwa worldwide and media buyer omd, works for advertisers such as mcdonald\\'s corp. and pepsico inc. publicis owns leo burnett and saatchi & saatchi as well as media-buying firm starcom mediavest and digital agencies such as razorfish. its clients include l\\'oreal sa, procter & gamble co. and renault sa. of the growing portion of global ad spending that is digital, the money flows disproportionately to google, which not only sells online search ads but runs an automated marketplace for buying online ads, and to facebook, which has a vast audience and plenty of user data. with revenue three times that of wpp last year, google is a formidable competitor for ad agencies, particularly in an industry where data collection has assumed greater importance. firms such as salesforce.com and adobe systems inc. are also moving more deeply into the industry, posing new competition for ad agencies. \"all of these tech players didn\\'t exist, didn\\'t compete, even on the fringes of our business, even five years ago,\" omnicom\\'s mr. wren said in an interview. the merger, he said, will \"create a lot of opportunities for us, some defensive and some offensive.\"advertisers use data to better aim their ads at certain demographic groups, taking into account people\\'sinternet surfing behavior or purchasing habits. to do this efficiently requires access to huge amounts of data, where google has a head start.\"it\\'s trillions of data that we have to crunch down in order to go down to very small segments or clusters of thepopulation to deliver some single messages to very the population of individuals,\" mr. levy said in an interview.\"for that we need scale.\"in a statement disclosing the deal, the publicis ceo noted that \"the communication and marketing landscapehas undergone dramatic changes in recent year landscape has the exponential development of new mediagiants, the explosion of big data, blurring of media giants all players and profound changes in consumerbehavior.\"he said the partners hope their com consumer behavior fit clients \"by bringing together the most comprehensiveoffering of analog and digital services.comprehensive offerings with rbc capital markets, said, \"the bigger an ad agency is, the more likely they are to have more access to consumer data and data around the pricing of online ad impressions,\" which helps them get the best price when buying from \"digital behemoths like google and facebook.\"meanwhile, an increasing portion of ads is being bought and sold on automated exchanges, known as\"programmatic buying,\" rather than through madison avenue media-buying firms that rely on relationships between media sales executives and ad buyers. while ad firms have set up their own automated trading desks, they face lots of competition. some advertisers, such as kellogg co., use independent providers instead of agency-owned trading desks. alternatively, advertisers can go straight to google, which owns doubleclick bid manager -- previously calledinvite media -- a system that allows advertisers to buy ad space across the web. to compete, ad companies have invested heavily in building systems that play in this arena and data that help improve their buying. maintaining and updating the systems can be expensive.\"with an integrated data and automated buying operation, the combined scale of publicis and omnicom would be better-positioned to compete against traditional agency competitors as well as nontraditional competitors like google,\" said rajeev goel, ceo at pubmatic inc., a tech company that helps website owners manage and sell ad space. data analysis is even playing a role in shaping of ads themselves. last year, samsung electronics co. minedtwitter for critical comments about the launch of apple inc.\\'s new iphone and used them to shape its ads. all the major ad-agency holding companies in recent years have been snapping up data scientists and engineers.\"there has been a huge shift in the way we do business,\" said jonathan nelson, chief executive ofomnicom\\'s digital business, in a recent interview. \"we are borrowing black-box trading techniques out of wallstreet; we are looking at genetic algorithms; we are looking at artificial intelligence; we are looking at predictive models; we are looking for anything that might give marketers an edge.\"in january, omnicom hired amit bhattacharyya as a data scientist at its data and analytics company, annalect. his background includes helping build a particle detector on a nasa-funded experiment during graduate studies and working as a quantitative analyst on wall street.\"when i was young, i thought i\\'d be an astronaut or a physics professor,\" he said. he was drawn to advertising by the bigger role played by data. the annalect unit has about 200 data scientists and programmers on staff, omnicom says. publicis also has hired many of these types of experts. the deal comes as companies increasingly squeeze down their costs for ad services, in some cases by delaying payments to agencies. the merger could give the ad companies more power to fight back.\"this consolidation could be favorable for profit margins at the holding companies because it reduces the competition when services are priced for clients,\" said brian wieser, of pivotal research group', 'onsemiconductor , driving energy efficient innovations, and aimotive, have jointly announced that

previously, the company\\'s archived assets were stored on various hard drives, organized on its internal systems, and distributed via dropbox and file transfer protocol (ftp) accounts. over the past six years, the volume of golden boy\\'s fight content and live studio shows such as \"between the ropes\" and \"mano amano\" has outpaced its internal capabilities, and the company needed a content

creator of the world\\'s first operating system for artificial intelligence,aiware(tm), today announced an agreement with art19, a leading podcast hosting, content management, monetization, and measurement platform. art19 will use aiware to run cognitive analysis and topical extraction on publisher podcasts that are part of art19\\'s targeted ad sales platform, making it possible forart19\\'s advertising partners to target ads based on the content of an individual podcast episode.\"art19 knows podcast advertising works. and advertisers know that ads can be incredibly successful if they\\'re reaching the right listeners at the right time,\" said lex friedman, chief revenue officer at art19. \"by adding aiware to our platform, we\\'re empowering buyers to target ads to consumers based on the content of the episode they\\'re listening to. listeners appreciate contextual and relevant ads -- and that means they pay more attention to them.\"art19 will integrate aiware\\'s transcription and topic analysis capabilities to enhance its targeted marketplace. the art19 sales team will then be able to place contextually relevant advertisements within the podcast based on its subject matter. programmatic digital audio ad serving generally allows advertisers to reach users based on a combination of targetable attributes derived from first-party and third-party user data. art19 will use aiware to identify the topics discussed in a podcast episode, enabling the digital audio ad server to target or exclude ads based not only on who is listening to the content, but on the topical taxonomy of that content. now, for example, a financial services firm can target ads to be played in podcast episodes that are discussing personal finance and are being listened to by 25- to34-year-olds. conversely, aiware can also support brand safety use cases, in which an advertiser requests that its ads be excluded from any podcast episodes that discuss controversial topics. before aiware, there was no way for art19\\'s employees to analyze and categorize topical metadata efficiently across thousands of podcast episodes. now, with aiware\\'s topical extraction capabilities, art19can automate this workflow and pass the metadata to the ad server, which will automatically include or exclude ads based on rule sets.\"we\\'re always looking for powerful tools that benefit everyone in our ecosystem to keep pushing podcasting forward -- for publishers, advertisers, and listeners alike,\" friedman added. \"aiware will lead to contextually relevant ads, which will serve publishers well in terms of revenue; yield great results for advertisers; and provide listeners with ads that feel native, custom, and in line with their interests.\"unlike a single-point solution that solves only one use case, aiware affords art19 a true ai operating system that makes its investment in ai future-proof. the aiware platform\\'s open architecture allows art19to integrate cognition from multiple machine learning algorithms into its existing technology stack seamlessly and to add more cognitive categories easily as new needs arise. aiware enables ad-tech capabilities within audio and video formats that were previously impractical because they exceeded the capacity and financial resources of human workforces. in a parallel to google\\'sindexing of websites, veritone\\'s aiware automates the systematic indexing and contextual extraction of hundreds of thousands of hours of audio and video content to enable new targeting and brand safety workflows,\" said veritone president ryan steelberg. \"art19\\'s deployment shows how refined targeting capabilities can deliver more efficiency for advertisers with a higher roi on ad spend, all while creating abetter

jointly announced a partnership that will position and deliver effective cost management for governments and enterprises in the region. the partnership will launch a cloud-based, advanced e-procurement system that extends the capabilities of existing procure-to-pay products, into business planning and improving interaction between buyers and their suppliers.cloudbuy is an integrated solution that takes a corporate buyer through a procurement process, from sourcing, order placement, payment, through to analyzing the purchase from a cost management standpoint, in a few mouse clicks. the solution then takes the process further with in-built controls and immediate audit facilities, eliminating rogue buying and off-contract pricing as well as ensuring compliance.cloudbuy has an exclusive partnership with visa, which offers a safe and controlled payment environment. the payment method also ensures that buyer organizations do not lapse on payment schedules with their suppliers and that suppliers have better cash flow with shorter payment periods. the payment method will particularly benefit sme suppliers who often suffer cash flow problems because of payment delays by buyers.\"economic forecasts in asia pacific markets, particularly the more developed ones, have called for austerity measures. we acknowledge that organizations are under pressure to cut costs and improve efficiencies quickly. they are looking for solutions that are not just quick fixes but provide sustainable cost management possibilities,\" said olivia leong, regional head of enterprise & government payment solutions, commercialproducts, visa, asia pacific, central europe, middle east and africa.\"we decided to extend visa\\'s collaboration with @ukplc that started in europe, to asia pacific. throughcloudbuy, we bring to market an enhanced electronic procure-to-pay solution that doesn\\'t just provide immediate cost savings, but will push companies to reassess their buying behaviors and payment methods to meet long-term cost management objectives,\" leong added. visa says that the partnership combines the strengths of the company\\'s issuer relationships, a proven network and a track record of bringing innovative payment solutions to the market, with @ukplc\\'s experience in developing and running e-commerce and cloud computing solutions for government and corporate clients.cloudbuy -- going beyond procure-to-paya key differentiator of cloudbuy is its starting point. the system operates on artificial intelligence technology that analyses a buying organization\\'s spend detail in just days. it gives an immediate assessment of compliance to raising purchase orders, price variances for the same product across the organization locally and globally, lost opportunities with volume discounts and special promotions, as well as a global price benchmark for the same product. the data and analysis will assist buying organizations to set realistic cost management targets even before cloudbuy is implemented. upon implementation, cloudbuy continues to offer data analysis that produces extensive reports that assist organizations with supplier management, contract negotiations and renegotiations, as well as real time tracking of cost management leading to better business forecasting.\"we have at hand the intelligence of having analyzed more than $500 billion of spend through ourspendinsight tool,\" said lyn duncan, ceo, ukplc. \"cloudbuy\\'s client base will benefit from the knowledge gained from @ukplc\\'s experience in analyzing corporate buying behavior as well as price variances across the globe. we remain steadfastly committed to helping organizations improve purchasing processes and achieving their strategic business goals.\"working with visa, we have been challenged to bring to market a technological solution that is easy to implement and use. buying organizations need not deal with high up-front investments and complicated set-up procedures. there will be a minimum training requirement for administrators and users.\"using the system is intuitive as it has been modeled to be an ecommerce site for corporate purchases. so anyone who is capable of online shopping through an amazon.com or travelocity will breeze throughcloudbuy. this ensures that the adoption rate is higher and organizations will see the benefits of implementation much faster,\" said duncan.cloudbuy for suppliersanother e-commerce influence that buyers can see on cloudbuy is its catalogue management system. typically in e-procurement systems, catalogue management resides with buying organizations that have to manually load suppliers\\' spreadsheet catalogues into their portals. this results in extra work for buyers and suppliers as well as out-of-date content and a limited ability to deal with services and more complex products.cloudbuy enables suppliers to manage their own content. suppliers are provided with a b2b website which enables them to manage their catalogue of goods or services, time based booking, pricing and discount structures, inform buyers of delivery charges, stock levels, as well as tax and currency. if suppliers maintain their own websites, cloudbuy can work with them to make those sites interoperable with the buyer\\'s cloudbuyportal.this is a significant step forward from a supplier standpoint as the website structure allows for them to promote their products and services at the right price, ensuring availability, and eliminating hidden costs for buyers, significantly reducing the possibility of disagreement on final purchase prices.cloudbuy will be first launched in australia in late 2013. other markets earmarked for first phase launch include new zealand, singapore and

experience to the users by clicking photos and make content swiftly. it gamifies the photo experience with the help of gifs which can act as a feed or slideshow of images to describe your day. at first look, the app seems to be a good engagement tool for celebrities and brands justified by the craze in people to know how they spend their day (through images). in general, it cuts down on a lot of irrelevant content used to share an experience through blogs as images can connect to the audience more than the content. wander creates a wanderlog, which is where one can capture experiences like adventures, a guide to a town, favorite works of street art or simply the places one loves. this in turns helps to make a network connecting places, posts and experiences bringing together wanderers with shared interests. what yahoo! gets from the deal with instagram and snapchat, photo content is on the rise and wander has as a team behind an app, which gives yahoo! an insight into how people spend their day through the medium of photographs clicked throughout the day. besides talent acquisition, this deal will support the artificial intelligence study with the data on human interactions. acquisition of aviate and wander are in sync with marissa mayer\\'s announcement in the beginning of this year, \"think about how much your phone understands about you - your contacts, calendar,

within the u.k. market to help monetize on its database of over 500,000 customers.prior to july, 2018, the u.k. prohibited the use of medical cannabis. since that time, the u.k. home secretary has announced that licensed clinicians will now be able to legally prescribe cannabis-derived medicines to patients, as an alternative to prescription drugs. as medical cannabis legalization in the u.k. progresses,namaste believes this acquisition will provide the company with the first-mover advantage in the u.k. market,which will enable them to implement a fully integrated platform and sales funnel based on namaste's currentcannmart business model. namaste is focused on creating the largest global platform for everything cannabis and in developing innovative technology. the acquisition of access fulfillment and its licence withmhra provides namaste with the necessary infrastructure to capitalize on a market where it maintains a strong market presence the company plans to submit its revolutionary telemedicine application and patient acquisition tool,namastemd, to the apple and google play stores, which will allow namaste to leverage its telemedicine application to acquire medical patients through on-line consultations in the u.k. by acquiring accessfulfillment, launching namastemd and developing supply relationships with domestic cultivators, namastewill have the infrastructure it needs to launch cbd and cannabis products into its marketplace in the u.k., subject to approval by mhra and other any applicable regulatory bodies.namaste has established itself as a global leader in cannabis e-commerce and technology. the company has incorporated revolutionary technology platforms like namastemd as well as its proprietary machine learning applications through the company's wholly owned subsidiary, findify ab. the company recently launched the first artificial intelligence-driven cannabis journalling app, my uppy cannabis journal, which is available internationally through the apple store and on android devices. these platforms allow namaste to create a highly personalized experience for every user, which helps optimize conversion rates and increase revenue.by acquiring access fulfillment, namaste will enter into a market much larger than canada, where it maintains a history of customer service excellence, strong revenue and brand loyalty. additionally, having the ability to acquire patients through a telemedicine app and distribute cannabis products through accessfulfillment's facility represents a unique opportunity to leverage a significant market. with access to over500,000 users in its u.k. database, the company is well-positioned as a global platform for all things cannabis\", ' ringcentral, inc., a leading

building sleekly designed,internet-connected products for the home, has sent shockwaves through the tech community - and for good reason. last weekâ\\x80\\x99s consumer electronics show (ces) in las vegas showed that the â\\x80\\x98internet of thingsâ\\x80\\x99  is going to be a big deal in years to come, with cisco ceo johnchambers predicting that the market will be worth $19 trillion by 2020. but despite this hype, most of the products showcased so far donâ\\x80\\x99t hold much attraction for the casual consumer. do you really want a washing machine that can text you? or a fridge you can take calls on? nestâ\\x80\\x99s brilliance is that it cuts through this confusion, creating technologies that have been hailed for their ease-of-use, attractive design, and for actually solving problems rather than creating them. they\\'ve only release two products so far, but both have been extremely well received. the nest thermostat (only on sale in the us and canda) learns users\\' habits - you set it manually a few times and it will pick up and automate temperature changes depending on your routine - whilst the protect smoke-detector takes some obvious steps forward by being easy to turn off (you can wave your hand at it), connecting up to your mobile for peace of mind on the move, and adding carbon monoxide detection to the traditional set up. peter nieh, a partner a lightspeed venture partners and a nest investor, told thefinancial times that the companyâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cmagic\" was its ability to â\\x80\\x9cmarry software and hardware in a way that makes

surprise. nest ceo and co-founder tony fadell is a former apple employee known as the\"godfather of the ipod\", and many are surprised that the company sold to google and not the iphone makers. business insider has suggested that this could be due to long-standing tensions between fadell and british-designer jony ive (credited with the look of apple\\'s most famous products and now head of industrial design at the company) but it isn\\'t the end of an apple relationship. nest has always supported ios and android products equally and has said it will continue to do so in the future. apple has yet to announce any decisive moves into the \\'internet of things\\' market, but it has a number of products in its roster that would fit well. ibeacons, for example, has been described as

something substanial down the line.', 'in a move that brings spotify ab\\'s music recommendation technology completely in-house and allows it to more aggressively compete against pandora, beats music, iheartradio, rdio and other services, the stockholm-based music streaming giant has acquired the echo nest corp. the deal is the culmination of a more than three-year relationship between somerville, massachusetts-basedecho nest and spotify, which is considered an ipo candidate. echo nest technology blends machine learning and natural language processing--the respective expertise of co-founders and mit doctorates tristan jehan and brian whitman--to build a database of songs and artists. the recommendation engine recognizes pitches, tempos and other similarities between songs and blends that data with a cultural understanding of songs and artists gleaned from blogs, music reviews and other online sources. the result: a recommendation engine that recognizes the meaning of lyrics in a norwegian death metal ditty and knows they would not be appreciated by christian music fans despite similarities in the syncopation. the echo nest engine has some similarities to the service offered by pandora, with one major distinction: other streaming music sites can, and have been, licensing echo nest technology as the personalization brain powering their operations for the past few years. spotify officially integrated the echo nest technology with its spotify radio app in 2011.\"we basically sell them pandora in a box,\" said echo nest board member and matrix partners generalpartner antonio rodriguez, noting that a number of large echo nest customers keep their identities private.\"they [streaming services] could try and develop this technology over several years or just buy it. it\\'s a real revenue business.\"in announcing the deal on their respective company blogs, echo nest and spotify each wrote that echonest\\'s api would remain available to developers for free. neither company mentioned what impact the deal would have on rdio, iheartradio and other echo nest customers. neither company responded to a request for additional comment.mr. rodriguez, whose firm began

acquiring digital technology firm sapient for $3.7 billion, a move aimed at accelerating the french ad holding company\\'s digital push. while that\\'s a hefty 44% premium for sapientshareholders, just how much of a game changer will the deal be for publicis? pivotal research analyst brian wieser said the acquisition has limited strategic impact for publicis, which hasn\\'t gained a meaningful edge in growth over its competitors despite its more aggressive push to scoop up big digital marketing firms. while sapient\\'s sapientnitro agency offers world-class digital marketing capabilities, mr. wieser in a research note monday said those offerings \"are not sufficiently unique to offer meaningful strategic benefits for publicis.\" additionally, the deal \"would make it harder for publicis to pursue something that might actually be \\'transformative\\' in the future, \"mr. wieser notes, adding that sapient \"would make a publicis acquisition of interpublic much more unlikely than it already appears presently.\"alfred fried analyst richard tullo in a note described the sapient deal as \"convoluted\" for publicis, as sapient derives about two-thirds of its revenue from digital advertising and the rest from industrial artificial intelligence and government services. he added that the \"cultural fit should be ok,\" since publicis already owns similar digital agencies such as digitas and rosetta. meanwhile, natixis analysts said the deal clarifies that \"publicis is positioning itself in the area of digital services rather than technology.\"publicis chief executive acknowledged in a conference call earlier monday that adding sapient\\'s consulting and technology services to its mix will help the company better deal with clients who are increasingly focused on reaching consumers through social media and e-commerce platforms. the sapient deal is a clear signal that publicis is maintaining its position of being a digital services business--unlike its rival wpp, which has taken a different route in adapting to the changing competitive landscape by going deep in ad technology. wpp, for example, recently invested $25 million in appnexus, whose technology is used in automated ad buying. publicis just six months ago walked away from a $35-billion plan to merge with rival omnicom, a deal that would have created the world\\'s largest ad holding company by revenue. publicis\\' chief executive mauricelevy has attributed the company\\'s weak results in recent quarters to distractions related to the failed deal and has emphasized his goal to transform publicis into a digital company. according to the company\\'s most recent earnings report, digital made up roughly 42% of publicis\\' revenue so far this year compared with 38%in the year-earlier period. publicis investors are weighing what the deal might mean for shareholder return: shares were down more than 2% so far today.', 'ibm\\'s acquisition of iris analytics brings new machine learning-powered fraud detection to the ibm portfolio.ibm today announced that it has acquired iris analytics, a privately held company specializing in real-time analytics to help combat payment fraud.based in koblenz, germany, iris offers a real-time fraud analytics engine that uses machine learning to generate rapid anti-fraud models. it also simultaneously supports the creation and modification of ad-hoc models proven successful on various sized payment platforms, ibm said.financial terms of the deal to acquire iris analytics were not disclosed. iris analytics is ibm\\'s first acquisition of 2016.the iris technology acts as a virtual analyst to help identify new fraud patterns, and it applies machine learning models to help analysts detect fraud and act quickly to help reduce fraudulent events, the company said. iris bridges the gap between expert-driven rules and traditional predictive modeling by applying artificial intelligence and cognitive techniques to partner with human experts in suggesting best- fit analytics interactively. the company s technology also allows for testing and deploying models with real production data, as it happens and without downtime.\"the cognitive computing approach unleashes a new paradigm in fighting fraud,\" said alistair rennie, general manager, industry solutions & offering management, ibm. \"the combination of iris analytics with ibm\\'scounter fraud technology will help organizations more accurately detect fraud at scale and speed so that they are in a position to implement countermeasures quickly, with more control and transparency, while at the same time assists with dramatically lowering false positives.\"big blue said only 16 percent of banks polled in a recent global ibm institute of business value study said they could detect fraud as it is attempted. the study also showed that once new schemes were identified and confirmed, it is estimated that countermeasures typically require longer than four weeks to deploy. existing fraud detection techniques are constrained by the dependency on specialized black box models that are hard to understand, explain, and adapt, ibm said. moreover, as the payments industry continues to evolve with faster, alternative and mobile payments innovations and the expanding use of chip and pin systems, fraudsters have become more technologically sophisticated and organized, adapting their fraud techniques more quickly to attack the new systems. according to ibm, iris is in use by leading banks and payment processors throughout the world. for example, the french payment card switch: e-rsb, operated by stet, uses iris for 5.5 billion annual credit and debit card transactions. \"with an average response time of less than five milliseconds per transaction even during peak periods when we are processing over 750 transactions per second, iris enables us to detect potential fraud without adding any notable overhead to our service, said pierre juhen, deputy ceo of stet. in addition, stet has been able to respond to newly identified fraud patterns by deploying new counter measures in a few hours without taking down the system, he said. defenses against financial crime are in critical need of innovation and improvement. as the payments industry evolves with new payments methods such as chip and pin, mobile payments and immediate payments, the ability for financial institutions to accurately make decisions about what is suspicious and what is legitimate before the payment is executed is required, said constantin von altrock, ceo of iris analytics', 'french medical equipment maker visiomed  said on monday it is  reinforcing its positions in artificial intelligence through the acquisition of an additional stake in

â\\x80\\x9cwork on a few more crazy ideasâ\\x80\\x9d.though he has a low profile outside asia, son has long been an unconventional, charismatic visionary in the often closed and clubby world of corporate japan, turning profits from japanese telecoms into bets on up-and-coming start-ups. not all have been a success: softbankâ\\x80\\x99s $22 billion acquisition of a controlling stake in loss-making sprint in2013 has left the group with hefty debts.softbank had an interest-bearing debt of 11.9 trillion yen at end-march, including 4 trillion yen at sprint, and its net debt currently

economy stagnates. softbank has raised nearly 2 trillion yen ($19 billion) in cash over the last few months through asset disposals, according to son â\\x80\\x93 including the sale of shares in chinaâ\\x80\\x99s alibaba, unusual for a group that has rarely exited investments. but analysts had expected it to use the cash to reduce debt or give shareholders a windfall by buying back its own shares. instead, son appears to have leapt on the opportunity presented by a battered sterling following britainâ\\x80\\x99s vote to leave the european union last month, and a strengthening yen. though arm has warned on the staffing impact of brexit, its revenues are largely in dollars, and its shares have climbed almost 17 percent since the vote. under the offer on monday, greeted by the uk government as proof that the economy is â\\x80\\x98open for businessâ\\x80\\x99, softbank said it was committed to keeping top managers, armâ\\x80\\x99s headquarters and to at least double the employee headcount in britain. announcing plans to stay on last month, son said he wanted to complete the transformation of softbank into a tech investment powerhouse. he has focused on what he calls the next â\\x80\\x98paradigm shiftâ\\x80\\x99 in technology, which includes artificial intelligence and the internet of things â\\x80\\x93 both increasingly important for arm as it weathers a smartphone slowdown. this year arm bought uk imaging specialist apical, which specializes in technology to allow computers to analyze images â\\x80\\x93 replicating human vision using software.

signed an agreement to acquire atlas 3d, inc., a plymouth, indiana-based developer of software that works with direct metal laser sintering (dmls) printers to automatically provide design engineers with the optimal print orientation and requisite support structures for additive parts in near real-time. atlas 3d will join siemens digital industriessoftware, where its solutions will expand additive manufacturing capabilities in the xcelerator portfolio of software.sunata(tm) software uses thermal distortion analysis to provide a simple, automated way to optimize part build orientation and generate support structures. this approach allows the designer--rather than the analyst--to perform these simulations, thereby reducing the downstream analysis that needs to be conducted via simcenter(tm) software to achieve a part that meets design requirements. siemens plans to make the atlas 3d solution available through its online additive manufacturing network.\"we welcome atlas 3d to the siemens community as the newest member of our additive manufacturing team. our solutions industrialize additive manufacturing for large enterprises, 3d printing service bureaus, design firms and cad designers,\" said zvi feuer, senior vice president, manufacturing engineering software of siemens digital industries software. \"the cloud-based sunata software makes it easy for designers to determine the optimal way to 3d print parts for high quality and repeatability. the combination of sunata with the robust cae additive manufacturing tools in simcenter enables a \\'right first time\\' approach for industrial 3dprinting. \"siemens is a leader in additive manufacturing, with the most integrated and functionally robust solutions in the industry, so we are excited to join the team,\" said chad barden, chief executive officer of atlas 3d. \"the power of sunata is that it equips designers to more easily design parts that are printable, which helps companies more quickly realize the benefits of additive manufacturing. as part of siemens, we look forward to introducing sunata to customers who already have siemens\\' am solutions and can achieve new efficiencies in their front-end design-for-additive process, as well as companies who have yet to start their additive manufacturing journey.\"the high rate of 3d print failures is a key challenge companies face in leveraging additive manufacturing for high-volume production. parts often need to go through several design and analysis iterations before the optimal build orientation and support structures are determined. typically, designers don\\'t have the capabilities to consider such factors as part orientation, distortion, and heat extraction uniformity in their design. this puts the onus on engineering specialists to resolve such issues. atlas 3d\\'s sunata software solves this problem by giving front-end designers a quick, easy and automated way to get much closer to a \"right first time\" build. sunata is a gpu-accelerated high-performance computing additive manufacturing software solution that can deliver results up to one hundred times faster than other build simulation solutions on the

develop a comprehensive solution for enhancing, operating and building \"brains\" for autonomous systems. per the company`s blog, autonomous systems in operation are envisioned to grow to approximately 800million by 2025. moreover, boston consulting group data, as revealed by siemens, projects world wide spending in the robotics sector to reach $66.9 billion by 2025, compared with $26.9 billion in 2015. bonsai`saddition to microsoft`s ai portfolio is in sync with the company`s intention to gain from this immense growth. capitalizing on the ai revolution we believe microsoft is on the right track, given its increasing inclination towards ai ever than before. the company`s focus on strengthening presence in the ai market is evident from the acquisition of berkeley, clbased bonsai. notably, in the past month, microsoft acquired semantic machines, which introduced an extensive approach for the development of conversational ai to advance its digital assistant cortana. in 2017, the company acquired ai startup maluuba, an expert in the field of deep learning and reinforcement learning for question-answering and decision-making systems. furthermore, microsoft acquired swiftket, anai startup earlier in 2016 for $250 million. these ai-based startups widen the scale of prospects for the tech giant. the company has also realized the immense power innovative software developers possess and how it can aid the company explore lucrative market opportunities. recent acquisition of github, the world`s largest open-source code repository, for approximately $7.5 billion reinforces the company`s ml initiatives. thegithub-azure integration will further strengthen microsoft`s commitment to cloud-computing future as it aims to compete against the likes of amazon and fellow tech giants. per a recent report by grand view research, the ai market is expected to hit $35.9 billion by 2025 at a cagr of 57.2% with 2017 as the base year. the projected figure takes into account direct revenue sources. given the huge growth prospect in the industry, microsoft is putting its best foot forward to grab a major share of the projected revenue growth. moreover, integration of ai techniques within cortana, office 365 and azurepresents a significant competitive edge to the company, in our view.', 'microsoft went shopping for ai startups and stopped its search at semantic machines, a newton-based startup that builds artificial intelligence software for home-automation devices and customer service for brands. the company also has an office in berkeley, california. its

with the people in the field. henderson said that avigilon\\'s expertise with video surveillance makes it a natural fit. \"we\\'re bringing to the table the eyes to their ears. you know, they\\'re a leader in voice and becoming a leader in other things,\" he said. \"we are a leader in video - video intelligence, video analytics, and high quality end-to end video solutions.\"avigilon is also deploying deep learning and artificial intelligence software that allows those surveillance cameras to do some incredible things.\"it actually learns what it\\'s looking at, and what is normal,\" henderson said. \"people walking down a street is normal. cars driving down the road is normal. now, all of a sudden if people start running in all directions -something it\\'s never seen before - it can trigger an alarm.\"the systems can also detect attributes like hair colour, sex and clothing colour, which allows operators to look for individuals, searching through video footage coming from dozens, or even hundreds of cameras. by launching a cloud system for operators, avigilon can also update security systems with new features over time. for some who follow the canadian tech industry closely, watching another canadian success story gobbled up by an american company brought a tinge of disappointment.\"i\\'ve heard the rumblings of the disappointment, but to be quite honest, i hear that disappointment from analysts,\" henderson said, with a hint of bemusement, adding that sale provided great value for shareholders. carl rodrigues, ceo and president of soti inc. - a mississauga based enterprise mobility management company - is a vocal advocate for growing canadian startups at home, instead of seeing them sold once they get big enough.\"i think there\\'s a lower bar we set for ourselves,\" rodrigues said.\"i want to build a company that rivals a google or a facebook or a tesla. i don\\'t really understand why canadian ceos in general don\\'t set the bar that high.

the american company snapchat. my son heard this and started whooping for joy,â\\x80\\x9d says zak. he rushed to tell all his friends â\\x80\\x93 â\\x80\\x98my dad works for snapchat! my dad works for snapchat!â\\x80\\x99 he used that app all the time.â\\x80\\x9dthe zak family werenâ\\x80\\x99t the only ones taken by surprise by the entry of snapchat (now called snap) into israel. the messaging app, on which messages and pictures are only accessible for a short time, was very popular with the young generation but not perceived as having any great technological vision. cimagine, a small company from kfar yehoshua that had raised just a few million dollars, developed an augmented reality technology that made it possible to installâ\\x80\\x9d virtual furniture or other items in a house. the connection between the companies wasnâ\\x80\\x99t totally clear then: snap did not elaborate on its plans, and the cimagine acquisition, for an estimated $40 million, was not officially announced. cimagine became snapâ\\x80\\x99sisrael research and development center, headed by zak. eleven months ago, snap expanded its presence in israel with the launch of a commercial section, headed by assaf sagy, to work with local advertisers and sell ads. eyal zakofer vakninuntil now, however, snap has kept its israeli activity under the radar. now, for the first time, executives agreed to talk about the challenges they contend with and their search for the next big thing. snapchat has become one of the apps most associated with the young generation. with 186 million daily users, it is far from being an empire on the scale of google or facebook, and has just had a particularly hard year, but it still has tremendous influence on media, social networks and digital communication. snap is responsible for a number of ideas and features that were later adopted by the tech giants and are now considered standard: messages with selfie pictures that are deleted after being sent; stories â\\x80\\x93 a series of pictures and videos that are deleted after 24 hours; filters and lenses â\\x80\\x93 illustrations and animations that can be added to selfies, such as a dogâ\\x80\\x99s ears and tongue, or a rainbow arcing out of a personâ\\x80\\x99s mouth).in the past two years, snap has had to sit by and watch mark zuckerbergâ\\x80\\x99s facebook shamelessly copy these features in a to ingratiate itself with the young audience. now, stories, filters and lenses can be found on facebook and all of the apps that it owns â\\x80\\x93 instagram, facebook messenger and whatsapp. 1.1 billion people now use the stories feature daily on the various facebook platforms. at the beginning of 2016, snap decided to upgrade the appâ\\x80\\x99s filters, lenses and animation experiences and make them more realistic and more precise (for example, the illustrated dogâ\\x80\\x99s ears must show up exactly on the userâ\\x80\\x99s head, and a big tongue should appear when he opens his mouth).to make this happen, it needed to acquire computer vision and ar capabilities. cimagine, founded in 2012by yoni nevo, nir daube, ozi egri and amiram avraham (who did not work in the company), fit the bill. there were companies in the global market that were developing a product similar to ours, but we were always one step ahead of them,â\\x80\\x9d says zak, who headed up the development of cimagineâ\\x80\\x99s mathematical engine at the time. weâ\\x80\\x99d gotten to know snap through various conferences and get-togethers. then one day they called and the acquisition process started.â\\x80\\x9dhe adds: snap is a serious company. they checked first to make sure the technology belonged to us and that we really developed it. they made sure we knew what we were talking about that our product really suited their needs.â\\x80\\x9dcimagine ceo nevo headed up development at the time but recently left his position. daube and egri, the engineering and product team, moved to snapâ\\x80\\x99s los angeles headquarters. the technology developed by cimagine eventually became world lenses, one of snapchatâ\\x80\\x99s most popular features. based on ar, it enables you to insert amusing virtual images in the world around you. for example, you could cause a dinosaur to wave its tail in the middle of the room, or insert a dancing hotdog with earphones.', \"us international

front-facing 3d laser scanner for facial recognition. adding merit to the rumour is another report from israeli financial website calcalist which states that apple has acquired realface, an israeli startup that developed deep learning-based face authentication technology. the terms of the deal aren\\'t public, but it\\'s estimated at \"several million dollars.\" in his report hall says the benefits of facial recognition over fingerprint recognition are that it is widely regarded as being more secure, something banks would prefer as mobile payment services expand; and that it will work well in wet conditions where touch id can be less reliable. the flip side is that facial recognition requires a more deliberate unlocking procedure of holding the phone upto your face which can be inconvenient and may make users more self-conscious than fingerprint unlocking. facial recognition can also be less reliable for users who wear glasses, contact lenses or sunglasses, something the iris scanner in samsung\\'s galaxy note 7 faced. if implemented, the cutting edge technology won\\'t come cheap. hall says the scanner will add $10-15 more to the manufacturing cost of a phone compared to the touch id module currently being used. coupled with the iphone 8\\'s widely reported switch to an oled display and all new chassis, the changes are expected to push the iphone 8\\'s

university of waterloo. it creates programs that use natural-language processing, which helps computers understand dialogue and develop reasoning capabilities in areas of research known as deep learning and reinforcement learning. microsoft and maluuba declined to disclose the purchase price. with maluuba\\'s software, for example, workers at large organizations can type a request to locate an employee with specific knowledge, such as a tax-law expert. maluuba\\'s natural-language technology would then sift through documents, emails and corporate directories to pinpoint the best person, according to a blog post from harry shum, microsoft\\'s executive vice president in charge of artificial intelligence. like many competitors, microsoft is racing to beef up its artificial-intelligence capabilities. last april, salesforce bought deep-learning startupmetamind, and in august apple inc.picked up machine-learningspecialistturi inc. last september, microsoft created an artificial-intelligence division with 5,000 employees, putting mr. shum in charge. the division includes both product managers and researchers, a pairing microsoft hopes will accelerate the rollout of artificial-intelligence offerings. maluuba\\'s technology has been used in smartphones and televisions from brands such as samsung electronics co. and lg electronics inc. a year ago, at the ces trade show in las vegas, the company worked with qualcomm inc. in a demo that let drivers communicate with an intelligent voice interface in a maserati car. at that time, maluubaalso raised $9 million from investors including emerillon capital and nautilus ventures to expand research and development. maluuba has raised $11 million in total, according to co-founder sampasupalak.ever since satya nadella became chief executive nearly three years ago, microsoft has been on an acquisition tear. it has picked up more than three dozen companies since, and elevated executives from acquired companies to senior posts to guide microsoft in emerging businesses. microsoft intends to retain all 50 maluuba employees, including mr. pasupalak and co-founder kaheersuleman, who will join microsoft\\'s artificial-intelligence group. and microsoft said yoshua bengio, the head of the montreal institute for learning algorithms and an adviser to maluuba, will continue in that capacity. mr.shum described

blog post announcing the deal. zander said the acquisition would combine azure public cloud infrastructure such as gpu processing capabilities and support for infiniband networking with cycle computing's orchestration and hpc heritage.the combination would enhance our support of linux hpc workloads and make it easier to extend on-premise workloads to the cloud, zander asserted. microsoft is the only major cloud provider currently supporting infiniband. the big computing deal would also seek to leverage microsofts recently announced plans to add gpuinstances based on nvidia's pascal generation of graphics processors to its azure cloud. azure currently includes nvidia m60 and k80 gpu instances, and the cloud vendor said it would add p40- and p100-based virtual machines later this year. google, ibm and other public cloud providers have also moved to integrate deploy nvidias pascal gpu into their cloud infrastructure as customers run compute intensive workloads. those upgrades target ai and deep learning workloads as well as hpc workloads such as dna sequencing and monte carlo simulations. those capabilities mesh with cycle computings current customer base that includes biomedical researchers and financial firms that use its cloud hpc software and orchestration tools to access cloud-based computing resources. cycle computing, which in the past has had strong ties to microsofts cloud rival, amazon web services, has also played a key role in transforming hpc technology as a provider of software that links users to the cloud.hpc workloads are always changing and

â\\x80\\x9csignificantly advance our shared vision,â\\x80\\x9d but go on to note that this will mean winding down support for focals 1.0, the first-generation smart glasses product that north released last year, and cancelling any plans to ship focals 2.0, the second-generation version that the company had been teasing and preparing to release over the last several months.focals received significant media attention following their release, and provided the most consumer-friendly wearable-glasses-computing-interface ever launched. they closely resembled regular optical glasses, albeit with larger arms to house the active computing components, and projected a transparent display overlay onto one frame which showed things like messages and navigation directions.around the focals 1.0 debut, north co-founder and ceo stephen lake told me that the company had originally begun developing its debut product, the myo gesture control armband, to create a way to interact naturally with the ambient smart computing platforms of the future. myo read electrical pulses generated by the body when you move your arm, and translated that into computer input. after realizing that devices it was designed to work with, including vr headsets and wearable computers like google glass, werenâ\\x80\\x99t far enough along for its novel control paradigm to take off, they shifted to addressing the root of the problem with focals. focals had some major limitations, however, including initially requiring that anyone wanting to purchase them go into a physical location for fitting, and then return for adjustments once they were ready. they were also quite expensive, and didnâ\\x80\\x99t support the full range of prescriptions needed by many existing glasses-wearers. software limitations, including limited access to appleâ\\x80\\x99s imessage platform, also hampered the experience for apple mobile device users. north (and myo before it) always employed talented and remarkable mechanical electronics engineers sourced from the nearby university of waterloo, but its ideas typically failed to attract the kind of consumer interest that wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve been required for sustained independent operation. the company had raised nearly$200 million in funding since its founding; as mentioned, no word on the total amount google paid, but it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t seem likely to have been a blockbuster exit. in an email to north customers, the company also said it would be refunding the full amount paid for any focals purchases â\\x80\\x94 likely to defray any complaints

call with one tap (a small touch, but one that makes dialing long conference pass codes much more bearable). in an announcement on the tempo website, the startup says: we started tempo to build an

and its all-star team according toâ\\xa0a new report from bloomberg.â\\xa0ottoâ\\xa0â\\xa0has been focusing on self-driving technology that could be fitted into trucks that are already on the road now. in other words, otto didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to develop its own self-driving vehicles â\\x80\\x94 the startup chose to focus on some sort of self-driving kit instead. otto makes its ownâ\\xa0lidar sensors.this fits perfectly into uberâ\\x80\\x99s strategy as the company doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want to become a car manufacturer. instead, uber has been looking at partnerships with existing car manufacturers, such as volvo, in order to turn their cars into self-driving cars using uberâ\\x80\\x99s proprietary technology. so get ready for uberâ\\x80\\x99s self-driving kit. and then, thereâ\\x80\\x99s ottoâ\\x80\\x99s team. anthony levandowski is well-known in the self-driving space as he used to work for google on googleâ\\x80\\x99s self-driving car effort in its early days. ottoâ\\x80\\x99s lior ron was head of product at google maps. given that mapping is a key element of self-driving cars, ronâ\\x80\\x99s experience could help as well. other engineers at otto have worked at tesla, apple and google. according to bloomberg, uber doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want to dismantle this team of 91 employees, so levandowski will lead uberâ\\x80\\x99s self-driving project, and the existing otto office in san francisco will become an uber r&d center. combining ottoâ\\x80\\x99s technology with uberâ\\x80\\x99sâ\\xa0massive push in mappingâ\\xa0makes uber stronger than ever when it comes to putting self-driving cars on the road. uber will also be able to use its huge user base to tap into ride data and improve its mapping solution. uber has no choice but to build self-driving technology if it wants to remain competitive for on-demand rides. itâ\\x80\\x99s clear that prices will drop drastically once uber can get rid of the driver in the front seat.', 'bull today announces

software for global enterprises to meet the challenges ofâ\\xa0big data, has acquired san francisco based ohmdata inc. (\"ohmdata\") for an enterprise value of approximately $2.1m, to be satisfied by the issuance of 274,477 new shares in wandisco (equivalent to 1.1% of current shares in issue). ohmdata develops database solutions based on the apache hbase (\"hbase\") database. hbase is a core component of the hadoop stack for processing large-scale data sets in real-time, and is used in mission-critical operations such as facebook and bloomberg messaging. ohmdata has filed a patent covering requirements such as efficient database power utilisation. wandisco has recently applied its continuous availability technology to hbase, and the ohmdata team will make a major contribution to further developing the wandisco non-stop hbase product. ohmdata, which has 3 employees, was co-founded by alex newman and ryan rawson, who will now join wandisco. alex newman is a committer of open source code to the hadoop ecosystem, whose code has been used in production for over 10 years. he has worked inâ\\xa0big data, network protocol design, software security and application development, including working on hbase for cloudera. ryan rawson is a core committer of hbase open source code and a member of the hbase project management committee. before co-founding ohmdata, ryan was a software engineer at google, where he worked on google\\'s \\'big table\\' forerunner to hbase, and amazon, where he developed synchronous cross-data centre distributed business logic. he specializes in large systems, (hundreds of nodes or servers), extensive code bases and multiple language environments. ohmdata\\'s unique expertise in design and development of databases is an important element of wandisco\\'s product development strategy. working alongside wandisco\\'s existingâ\\xa0big dataâ\\xa0and distributed computing experts such as dr. yeturu aahlad, dr. konstantin shvachko, dr. konstantin boudnik and jagane sundar, they will enhance wandisco\\'s ability to develop further ground-breaking technology, not least because of their ability to commit new hadoop code to improve integration between wandisco\\'s products and the hadoop open source platform. wandisco has already demonstrated that, by applying its patented active-active replication technology to hadoop, it can make hadoop resilient for enterprise deployments. ohmdata will continue this work with hbase to significantly add to wandisco\\'s ability to execute in theâ\\xa0big dataâ\\xa0market. gartner analysts merv adrian and nick heudecker see hbase and other additional components as key to the relevance of hadoop and comment: \"as hadoop core and related projects have progressed, its viability as a platform has been enhanced and substantial numbers of vendors in multiple categories, such as business analytics, data integration and workload management, have introduced products that assume its presence. version 2.x of apache hadoop enables greater scalability and availability and expands beyond its batch processing roots to encompass new workloads and processing styles.\"* david richards, chief executive officer of wandisco comments: \"we have again demonstrated that wandisco can attract the top talent in the industry. alex and ryan come to us having worked as core technologists at some of the biggest names in the industry such as google, cloudera and amazon. hbase is a critical component of
