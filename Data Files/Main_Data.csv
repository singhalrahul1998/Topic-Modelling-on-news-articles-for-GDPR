The partnership is set to be announced next week at a conference for AWS users, according to two people familiar with the company's plans. Both Rackspace and Amazon declined to comment. The deal mirrors an earlier agreement, announced in July, under which Rackspace is helping companies that want to use Microsoft Corp.'s Azure cloud-computing platform move their operations there. Introduced in 2006, AWS was billed a fast way for software developers to gain access to basic computing power over the Internet. The service has evolved, however, and today it offers a broad array of options, from data warehousing to artificial intelligence. AWS generated $1.82 billion in revenue and grew by 81%year-over-year during Amazon's most-recent quarter.AWS's customers have evolved, too. The service initially was popular with fast-growing Internet startups such as Netflix and Airbnb. Two years ago, Amazon won a $600 million contract to set up a cloud-computing system for the Central Intelligence Agency. Today, AWS lists clients outside of the tech industry including Nike Inc., Pfizer Inc., and Time Inc. The deal would have been unthinkable just two years ago, when Rackspace and AWS were fierce rivals. Butin early 2014, Rackspace, facing ever slimmer margins amid a cloud-computing price war, withdrew from head-to-head competition with Amazon. Since then, it has focused on offering higher-margin services. Partnerships like the one between AWS and Rackspace will become increasingly important as Amazon seeks to sell to more non-tech firms"

Leading organizations are expanding the use of simulation into operations by creating digital twins - virtual representations of individual operating assets whose performance and productivity can be improved dynamically through simulation technology. Coupling the rich sensor data from increasingly smart industrial equipment with the predictive power of simulation, specific operating conditions can be analyzed and failure points predicted, unlocking billions of dollars in production and maintenance optimization. Digital twins can live with the asset, providing a dynamic self-teaching model used to optimize its performance in conjunction with an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform. This combination of machine learning, coupled with physics-based modeling, enables organizations to see how their products performed in the past and predict the future simultaneously. Using ANSYS to create model-based digital twins will provide a foundation to scaling the benefits of the IIoT. This is no longer a theoretic concept as ANSYS and GE Global Research are already demonstrating actual implementation of digital twins, like the GuardEon Molded Case Circuit Breaker, a powerful low-voltage circuit breaker designed for global industry applications. By using ANSYS software, GE engineers are able to study and test complex physics at a level of detail that was impossible to achieve through physical testing. ""Pairing physics and analytics models via the digital twin is essential to providing our customers with the 360degree insights they need to create competitive advantage in a rapidly changing world,"" said Eric Bantegnie, ANSYS vice president. ""We are excited to be taking another step forward in our long-standing partnership with GE. ""Through this collaboration, ANSYS will work with GE Digital, GE Global Research and GE's industrial businesses to expand and integrate ANSYS' leading physics-based engineering simulation and embedded software development platform with GE's Predix platform to power digital twin solutions across a wide rangeof industries. Scaling digital twin solutions from the edge to the cloud will accelerate the value of ANSYS simulation, drive Predix adoption and open new opportunities to explore disruptive business models and commercial relationships.""We are building the digital industrial ecosystem to drive better outcomes for our customer through the Predix platform,"" said John Magee, Chief Marketing Officer, Predix. ""ANSYS is the market leader in physics-based simulation, and we are pleased to work with them to scale model-based digital twin solutions on Predix to provide our customers with new insights that were not possible before."""

This time it's secretive artificial-intelligence company Perceptio, a deal which comes on the heels of AAPL's acquisition Friday of UK-based software maker VocalIQ, which is working with GM to develop a voice-navigation system. ""Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,"" says a spokesman via email, declining to provide further details. Other smaller AAPL deals of late have included mapping startup Mapsense and GPS startup Navigation Inc., moves to try to make Apple Maps more competitive"
21,13,AIU15,Apple,US0378331005,1690,USA,AAPL,16657,22-08-2016,Gliimpse,USA,," One of Silicon Valley's tech behemoths is taking a step further into digital medicine. Apple quietly acquired the personal health data start-up Gliimpse, according to a report from Fast Company. Gliimpse takes a patient's medical records and uses coding to produce a personalized, shareable electronic health record. Anil Sethi, a former systems engineer at Apple with a master's of science from Johns Hopkins, founded the start-up in 2013, according to his LinkedIn profile. Apple did not immediately respond for comment. The Cupertino, Calif. -based tech giant has been expanding into digital health since releasing its Health Kitapp -- which helps users monitor personal health and fitness data -- with the iPhone 6 in 2014. It also worked with hospitals and doctors to create a research-tracking app for common diseases like Parkinson's and breast cancer, and allowed anyone to become an organ donor using an iPhone. The company may have also acquired the machine learning platform Turi for $200 million earlier this month. Apple isn't alone in pursuing AI for medicine. Google announced plans to use artificial intelligence to recognize the signs of common eye diseases using medical records of 1. 6 million patients in London hospitals. Despite Google, Facebook and other companies' early ventures into artificial intelligence, Apple CEO TimCook said Apple led the industry in artificial intelligence with voice-controlled personal assistance Siri, released in 2011, and isn't stopping anytime soon.""(The) level of performance (in smartphones) is going to skyrocket"" with coming leaps in artificial intelligence,Cook said in an interview with The Washington Post. ""And there is nothing that's going to replace it in the short term or in the intermediate term, either. "
22,13,AIU16,Apple,US0378331005,1690,USA,AAPL,75654,29-04-2010,Siri,USA,,"In a move designed to compete more closely with Google' Android platform, Apple, is buying mobile application developer Siri for its technology that lets users perform voice-activated Web searches from their smartphones. Siri, a start-up based in San Jose, makes a voice recognition and search application it describes as a virtual personal assistant, and began offering it for the iPhone this year. Users speak commands, and the application translates and uses search algorithms to find the answers. Siri partnered with companies including Citysearch, OpenTable, and Taxi Magic to get results. For the latest Apple tablet news, opinion and conversation, be sure to check out Information Week's  Special Report:  Tablet Wars -- Can Apple Three-peat? Siri had raised a total of $24 million from investors prior to its sale to Apple, including Menlo Ventures and LiKa-Shing, a Chinese billionaire who has also invested in Facebook. The acquisition agreement has been signed but the deal hasn't closed yet, according to Shawn Carolan, a managing director at Menlo Ventures. Carolan, who sits on Siri's board, said the Apple offer ""had to be very compelling"" for the executive team and the board to accept. He declined to disclose the terms. Industry observers believe Apple will at some point want to offer an alternative to Google's search service on the iPhone, the iPod Touch and the iPad. Google has invested heavily in voice command search, location-based search and advertising and in visual recognition search. Siri's management team includes artificial intelligence experts, and the product grew out of the SRI Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes (CALO) Project, the largest artificial intelligence project in the U.S.,funded with $150 million from DARPA, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. For Siri, the Apple acquisition means the start-up will be able to scale its application. Right now, Siri is built forthe iPhone 3GS and the iPod touch and works only in the U.S. With Apple's support, Siri will be able to push its application to other devices and expand outside the U.S.Apple CEO Steve Jobs began describing his company as a mobile devices maker this year, and in recent months has increased the number of acquisitions in order to add technologies and features to its gadgets.The Cupertino-based Apple competes with Research In Motion's BlackBerry and devices running Google'ssoftware in smartphones, a segment that's outpacing the rest of the handset market.

In addition to offering call center customers with instant updates for complying with Do-Not-Call regulations through the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Call Compliance Inc., we believe the Execuserve acquisition strengthens Compliance Systems Corporation's position in providing a vertically integrated software suite by offering a ""new hire"" software program which conducts dynamic assessments of prospective job seekers with embedded features, including artificial intelligence, marketed as Hire-Intelligence(TM) and Hire-Choice(TM). We believe Execuserve's Hire-Intelligence(TM) and Hire-Choice(TM) software platform is architected to provide call center customers, and other industries, that traditionally experience high rates of employee churn, with efficiencies to reduce ""new hire"" expenses. Typically, call center operators will hire up to 4 individuals with an expectation that only one new hire employee will be successful over the long term. We anticipate Execuserve's Hire-Intelligence(TM) and Hire-Choice(TM) software platform will be marketed to existing and future Call Compliance customers, and may provide a competitive advantage in the call center space currently comprised of more than 56,000 call centers nationwide with over 5,000,000 employees, which represent about 4% of the U.S. workforce.""With the close of the Execuserve acquisition, we believe we've achieved an exciting milestone and an important and consistent next step in our strategy to become the foremost end-to-end call center solution provider in the market today,"" said Dean Garfinkel, Chairman and CEO of Compliance Systems Corporation.""We anticipate the combined resources, talent and track record of Call Compliance and Execuserve create a platform for accelerated innovation, expanded service and support, and improved delivery of the results that matter most to our call center customers.""As part of the Execuserve acquisition, Compliance Systems Corporation has modified its organizational structure to account for the Execuserve acquisition and its operational management team.

48,36,AIU38,ConversionPoint,US21255G1022,#REF!,USA,,90708,06-05-2019,Inuvo,USA,,"This week promises to be a busy one for ConversionPoint Holdings Inc., in its bid to be Orange County's first company to go public this year. The Newport Beach-based e-commerce advertising services provider is looking to buy Inuvo Inc., a LittleRock, Ark.-based artificial intelligence company whose software is used by clients for their business-to-business and business-to-consumer marketing efforts. Inuvo is a publicly traded firm with a market value of about $48 million as of last week.ConversionPoint announced plans last November to acquire the public company and combine the two firms' technology platforms under a new corporate umbrella, in a $75.5 million stock-and-debt deal that would be financed in large part through an initial public offering, whose plans have been in the works for nearly six months. Updated IPO plans were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week. ConversionPointaims to raise around $45 million, with 6.1 million shares offered between $6 and $7 each. Such a deal would value the company at nearly $ 190 million. About $23 million in proceeds from the offering would pay the cash portion of the Inuvo deal, with the remainder largely going to pay down debt. Inuvo's stock would stop trading if the deal with ConversionPoint is completed, and the combined company would be based in Newport Center, where ConversionPoint employs about 85 people. The company would remain led by Chief Executive Robert Tallack.The company's based in the Pacific Financial Plaza office complex that also holds the headquarters of virtual reality broadcasting firm NextVR Inc., local offices of law firm Irell & Manella LLP and others. Inuvo shareholders are scheduled to vote on the impending sale to ConversionPoint on May 8-they'd own a little under 30% of the combined company's stock-and the IPO is expected to be finalized shortly after that.ConversionPoint plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol CPTI. The offering is being underwritten by Op-penheimer & Co., GMP Securities and D.A. Davidson & Co., while the Irvine offices of Troutman Sanders LLP are handling much of the legal work for the IPO. Al, SaaSThe marriage between Conversion-Point and Inuvo hinges on the promise of computers simulating intelligent behavior. Specifically, leveraging artificial intelligence to boost online retail sales, and glean the shopping habits and characteristics of hundreds of millions of consumers. ConversionPoint plans to leverage Inuvo's technology to expand into higher margin offerings, such as software and managed services, while moving away from its legacy e-commerce business.Its mission is to provide a ""data driven"" Al-powered e-commerce platform for small- and mid-sized businesses, the company stated in regulatory filings.Both companies are coming off of down years, marked by falling sales and rising losses.Inuvo, which was established in 1999, saw revenue decline 7.8% to $73.3 million in 2018.The company attributed the decline to cutting ""non-strategic technologies including a proprietary marketing platform.""The revenue decrease, according to the company, led to a $5.9 million net loss in 2018, compared to a loss of about $3 million the prior year.Inuvo revenue is highly concentrated and reliant upon Yahoo, Google and Microsoft Online. The three giant service providers last year accounted for nearly 87% of sales, with Yahoo alone driving more than 71 % of revenue, according to the filing.ConversionPoint, launched in 2015 in Irvine, reported revenue of nearly $40 million last year, down 20%.It works with firms including Walmart, Lowe's, Costco and Office Depot and other major online retailers, which integrate the company's JavaScript tags on their online retail store web pages, allowing Conversion-Point'sbrand customers to ""directly publish interactive experiences and product information to such retail websites.""The company in the second quarter last year shifted its focus from e-commerce product sales-a segment dominated by Amazon.com-to further develop and expand managed services and its software as a service, or SaaS, business.The moves slashed revenue from its e-commerce business 51% to $20.3 million, while cutting product offerings from nine to four.Its e-commerce products primarily are sold through trial offers, in which consumers must opt out of monthly billed subscriptions.The pivot, combined with increased operating expenses, drove a loss of $33.2 million last year, compared to net income of $400,000 in 2017.On a positive note, revenue from managed services doubled to $16 million, while SaaS revenue climbed more than 1,000% to $3.5 million, largely as a result of its $17.2 million buy of Sellpoints Inc. in late 2017.Growth Plans The combined company will have revenue of about $113 million and 145 employees once the merger is completed.Managed services will account for nearly 80% of revenue, followed by e-commerce, 18%, and SaaS, 3%.ConversionPoint wants to boost SaaS sales to 60% of annual revenue, and eventually eliminate its e-commerce line completely.It coveted Inuvo's high-margin AI-powered IntentKey product, which it plans to upsell to customers. The technology is used by Fortune 500 companies to help attract consumers to specific landing pages or to take action.The software stores and updates more than 500 million, anonymous consumer profiles, and processes 20billion ads per day, identifying some 24 million concepts, such as objects, ideas, emotions and places.Inuvo technology pushes a billion marketing messages to consumers every month.""This creates an increasingly large market opportunity for data driven e-commerce solutions to assist brands and retailers,"" ConversionPoint said in the IPO filing.Global e-commerce sales hit $2.9 trillion last year, according to e-Marketer.com, with sales pegged to grow between $70 and $80 billion this year."

Starting in early 2016, Dell will be the only tier one PC vendor to offer a comprehensive security suite integrating Cylance technology with the introduction of Dell Data Protection | Endpoint Security SuiteEnterprise. Cylance is the cybersecurity company that uses artificial intelligence to proactively prevent, rather than just reactively detect, advanced persistent threats and malware. This collaboration builds on the DellVentures investment in Cylance earlier this year as part of its commitment to support new businesses that align with Dell s strategic direction. Customer needs are no longer adequately being met by traditional, signature-based anti-virus and anti-malware solutions in today s fast-evolving threat landscape. Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise withCylance technology will protect against the execution of advanced persistent threats and malware including zero day attacks, scripting attacks and targeted attacks such as spear phishing and ransomware. According to Cylance testing, the new solution will achieve a significantly higher level of protection, stopping 99 percent of malware and advanced persistent threats, far above the average 50 percent efficacy rating of many traditional anti-virus solutions. Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise integrates a deep understanding of attack vectors with sophisticated artificial intelligence and algorithmic science to provide superior endpoint protection against both present and future threats. According to a Dell-commissioned survey, 61 percent of medium to large organizations prefer purchasing security as part of an integrated suite. Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise integrates authentication, encryption and advanced threat protection into one security suite. It requires a fraction of the IT resources that would traditionally be required to maintain an effective advanced threat protection solution, enabling remote management of all components using a single console. The solution prevents threats without the need of a constant cloud connection, frequent updates or a persistent network connection, while providing IT departments with less false positive readings and no signature updates. It also enables compliance with industry standards, meeting PCI DSS Requirement 5 and HIPAA requirements for anti-virus and anti-malware solutions. Additionally, the technology uses a fraction of the system resources associated with anti-virus and traditional malware protection solutions, which means better performance for end users. Dell s ProSupport for Software is bundled with every purchase. It provides 24x7 access to certified engineers whose deep knowledge and expertise can help identify and quickly resolve issues. Additional Protection for Dell Commercial PCs with Endpoint Security Suite EnterpriseDell Latitude and OptiPlex PCs are the most secure commercial PCs in the industry today with best-in-class endpoint security solutions from the Dell Data Protection suite, including comprehensive encryption, advanced authentication and leading-edge malware protection from a single source. The new solution will make the most secure PCs today even more secure by providing customers with effective advanced threat protection that s required to prevent today s increasingly common cyber attacks. This extends Dell commitment to providing customers the most secure commercial PCs available today, while also providing security solutions that work across heterogeneous environments, meaning data is protected as it moves across various devices and through public and hybrid clouds that make up most modern work scenarios."

In one deal, GE Healthcare will increase its use of Intel Corp.'s Xeon processors to build both on-premise and off-site data storage arrays for customers. The goal, according to the companies, is to lower the cost of ownership of medical imaging devices by 25 percent by optimizing the way hospitals store the images.Intel employs around 20,000 workers in Hillsboro"
65,51,AIU51,GE Healthcare,,,USA,GE,23579,28-11-2017,NVIDIA,USA,,"In the other deal, GE Healthcare unveiled a new CT scanner, the Revolution Frontier CT, which promises to work twice as fast as its predecessor due to its reliance on NVIDIA's artificial intelligence technology. The graphics-processing chips made by California-based NVIDIA Corp. (Nasdaq: NVDA) have been at the center of recent advances in AI, especially when it comes to analyzing large numbers of images. The two companies are also partnering to create the GE Healthcare Applied Intelligence Platform to ""to accelerate the creation, deployment and consumption of deep learning algorithms in new healthcare analytic applications."" GE estimates that the average hospital produces 50 petabytes of data every year, but that only abut 3 percent of that data is able to be properly analyzed. It's not GE's first foray into artificial intelligence and healthcare. In May, GE Healthcare announced a 10-year partnership with Partners HealthCare to develop AI applications for every part of a patient's interaction with a hospital, starting with a focus on diagnostic imaging."
66,51,AIU52,GE Healthcare,,,USA,GE,76230,21-08-2019,Tampa General Hospital,USA,,"Tampa General becomes the fourth hospital in the world and first in Florida to open a command center in partnership with GE HealthcareTAMPA, Today Tampa General Hospital launched a high-tech ""mission control"" clinical command center which uses artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to improve and better coordinate patient care at a lower cost. The hospital's new center is called CareComm and has been developed in partnership with GE Healthcare. It features 20 artificial intelligence apps, video walls with 38 large screens, 32 work stations, multiple computer systems, and a multi-disciplinary clinical team that includes doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals.CareComm staff use these resources to predict the needs of patients and team members before they arise.With CareComm, Tampa General can anticipate potential roadblocks and issues in the care process,ensuring that rooms, equipment and medical professionals will be available for patients as soon as they're needed.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came to TGH for the CareComm unveiling on Tuesday and said he was impressed by the innovation.""If you had told me we were in Kennedy Space Center in there, I probably would have believed you,"" the governor said. He said TGH staff had explained how CareComm helps different hospital departments collaborate and avoid communications silos. ""They've broken down all these barriers and are able to achieve efficiencies and I think that's great.""""CareComm is a new center at Tampa General Hospital that harnesses technology and ingenuity to further improve healthcare,"" DeSantis said. ""Ensuring Floridians have access to higher quality and more affordable healthcare has been a priority of my administration. I look forward to seeing CareComm's impact in the Tampa Bay Community.""The center will improve quality while decreasing costs, said John Couris, president and CEO of TampaGeneral Hospital.""CareComm is a huge step in our journey to become the safest and most innovative academic health system in the country,"" Couris said. ""We're grateful to our physicians, nurses, staff, and our GE Healthcare partners for helping us leverage technology to drive quality up and costs down. This means better care and lowercosts for patients.""Several other elected officials attended the unveiling on Tuesday.CareComm's temporary facility, open since December, already has helped TGH reduce the average patient's length of stay in the hospital by about half a day. This creates a better experience for patients who are ready to leave the hospital and also allows new patients to get to their rooms sooner. Reducing such inefficiencies has saved about $10 million -- savings that ultimately benefit staff and patients.All this data and analysis is focused on one goal -- providing world-class care to patients in a more efficient way.""CareComm helps us ensure that each patient gets the best possible care right when they need it,"" said Dr.Pete Chang, vice president of Care Transitions. ""Because our CareComm team is focusing on smoothing each patient's journey through the hospital, our clinical team at the bedside has more time to spend with the patient.""TGH doctors, nurses and administrators already work to manage the flow of patients, but it's a complex task at a 1,007 bed academic medical center that on any given day treats people for cancer, traumatic accidents,heart attacks, infectious diseases and transplant operations.CareComm uses the best of human ingenuity and artificial intelligence to manage this process.Part of the reason that CareComm is working so well is because our team work elevates technology,"" said Kelly Cullen, executive vice president and chief operating officer. ""We've got teams from across the hospital --from nurses to transport staff to environmental services -- sharing and acting upon information in CareCommto help our team members make sure our patients get the best care."" The center uses technology developed by GE Healthcare.""Tampa General's focus on team, patients and innovation was apparent from our first interaction,"" said JeffTerry, CEO of Clinical Command Centers for GE Healthcare. ""It's a terrific environment. The CareCommprogram includes a digital twin of TGH and a range of process improvement projects. Today is a terrific milestone for John and his team, the results are already impressive, and there's so much innovation still ahead.""CareComm's features include:-- 20 artificial intelligence apps, or ""tiles,"" from GE Healthcare. These tiles process hundreds of messages every minute, apply advanced analytics,and then provide decision support for CareComm staff-- Individual ""tiles"" that monitor patient flow, track any delays in care,and even spot early warning signs that a patient's health may be declining-- 38 large screen LCDs so the tiles can be displayed with live data all the time-- 4 of the LCDs are touch screens so staff can manipulate tiles during huddles and meetings-- Carefully designed processes used by CareComm staff to help team members in the moment Why are these changes important? It's all about improving the care to patients -- and improving their healthoutcomes. Getting patients connected with nurses, doctors and hospital rooms at the soonest possible time often improves their care. ""We all know the earlier you treat someone, the better the outcome is, generally speaking, "" Chang said.TGH hospital began a temporary scaled-down version of CareComm in December and moved into a new8,000 square-foot headquarters on the hospital's main campus today. The coordination provided by CareComm also has enabled TGH to open a new Departure Lounge to further improve patients' experience and patient flow. Instead of waiting in their hospital room to receive their take-home medicine or for their ride home, patients are now able to go to the lounge. It has comfortable chairs, televisions, wi-fi, plus free coffee and snacks. This allows patients to wait in a friendly and comfortable atmosphere, and it also opens up hospital beds sooner for those with acute needs.""CareComm is the kind of innovation that Tampa General stands for,"" Couris said. ""Our commitment is to design a system that creates a sustainable and reproducible way to drive up the quality of care and lower of cost. We want to pass this value on to the patients, the payors, and the employers, creating a less expensive delivery model for health care in our state."""
67,52,AIU53,GeckoSystems International Corporation,,,USA,GOSY,14295,29-11-2011,Nanle Electric Wheelchair Co.,China,," announced today that negotiations establishing a new JointVenture under direct sponsorship of the government of the People's Republic of China, Nanle ElectricWheelchair Co., have been completed. The CEOs of both organizations have signed the Joint Venture agreement. GeckoSystems is a dynamic leader in the emerging mobile robotics industry revolutionizing their development and usage with ""Mobile Robot Solutions for Safety, Security and Service(TM)"". GeckoSystems will realize a significant boost in exposure of its new ""collision proof"" wheelchair technology using its mobile robot solutions. This agreement enables GeckoSystems' technology to have more credible worldwide visibility for their new technologies as well as their mature technologies. This will give GeckoSystems a competitive cost advantage entering into commercial markets such as healthcare, security, and government applications. It has been agreed that there will be an exchange of stock between GeckoSystems and Nanle. GeckoSystems' CEO will have a seat on the board of directors for the newly created company. Mechanical design criteria for a more appropriate wheelchair configuration designed to leverage the benefits of power mobility under artificial intelligence (AI) navigational control, has already been submitted to the Chinese engineers that will be working with Nanle. Both parties agreed that: In order to protect safety and security of the people and society from terrorists, the core technologies shall be strictly confidential and the JV Company and the Wheelchair Manufacturer shall take special care to keep the technologies secret. Because of the importance of this venture to GeckoSystems' Chinese business partners, and to the People of China, land has been purchased and construction will soon begin on a new factory. Heightened demand for advanced healthcare products like the ""collision proof"" wheelchair that uses GeckoSystems advanced AI navigation system is a direct result of the plan announced by the government of the People's Republic of China in 2009 to ""deepen healthcare"" system reforms. This plan sets the ambitious goal of universal health care in China by 2020. Among the many changes coming to the medical system in China is greater mobility for the disabled, and Nanle wheelchairs will be a key part of this effort, delivering leading edge wheelchair technology and design to the Chinese people. Conservative market estimates for the need for wheelchairs in China are impressive. Worldwide, the average usage for wheelchairs is one percent (1%) of the general population. In China that would be equal to 13,400,000 people. Worldwide, wheelchair sales per year average 0.0515% of the population. In the PacificRim, excluding Japan, that number is only is 0.0138%. In order to meet its stated healthcare goal for 2020, the Chinese government has to manufacture and distribute an estimated 5,270,000 wheelchairs over the next ten years. This will bring them in line with the world average. If only twenty percent (20%) are powered and ""collision proofed,"" that is over 100,000 electric wheelchairs per year, over 8,000 per month. At an average cost of at least $1,500 each, that represents annual sales of $150,000,000 per year in main land China alone."

Jetpac's technology scans pixels in public Instagram photos to match up features in photos or surroundings. The app can identify blue skies or clouds, women who wear lipstick, or men with a mustache drinking a cup of coffee. The app serves up places that are most frequented in a city by a specific type of person such as a dog lover in Central Park.Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012, for about $1 billion in cash and stock. Aside from the Jetpac City Guide that provides insight into places types of people frequent, the company developed object recognition technology with the ability to recognize objects, shapes and texture like fur. It can combine these signals to identify breeds of plants and dogs.Jetpac's app, Jetpac City Guides, was pulled from the App Store. The technology, based on deep learning and artificial intelligence, caught interest early on from former Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang, Khosla Ventures and Morado Venture partners. The company hassecured$2.4 million in funding since 2012.No word from Google on the company's plan for the technology. When Jetpac rolled out the free City Guides app, the company's promotion began touting the technology's ability to analyze millions of photos on Instagram to determine the happiest cities in the United States. Take that technology and throw it into an ad-targeting platform that can analyze intent, and the advertising industry could see the germ of a seed that combines analytics, business intelligence and artificial intelligence to more accurately target advertisements across offline and online platforms"

The banking group is implementing the company's AI technology to automate anti-money-laundering investigations that have traditionally been conducted by thousands of humans, the bank's Chief Operating Officer Andy Maguire said in an interview last week. The vast majority of anti-money-laundering investigations at banks do not find suspicious activity, resulting ina waste of resources, according to the startup. In a pilot of Ayasdi's technology, HSBC saw the number of investigations drop by 20 percent without reducing the number of cases referred for more scrutiny, according to the startup.""It's a win-win,"" Maguire said. ""We reduce risks and it costs less money.""Banks have been ramping up their use of AI and automation over the past year to save money and time on cumbersome and manual processes ranging from compliance checks to customer service. At the same time they have been working more closely with young financial technology companies and reducing the amount of technology that gets built in-house. One of the financial technology areas that has seen significant collaboration has been so-called ""regtech"", or technology that can help financial institutions stay compliant with regulations and avoid hefty fines in are as such as money laundering or market manipulation. In 2012 HSBC agreed to pay a $1.92 billion in fines to U.S. authorities for allowing itself to be used to launder  drug money out of Mexico and other compliance lapses. To cope with increased regulatory scrutiny and a swathe of new rules, banks went on a compliance hiring spree in the years following the financial crisis.Anti-money laundering checks ""is a thing that the whole industry has thrown a lot of bodies at it because that was the way it was being done,"" Maguire said.Banks have recently started cutting back on compliance hiring as they start deploying new technology that can help automate some of the tasks.  Maguire said AI technology can help with compliance because it has the ability ""to do things human beings are not typically good at like high frequency high volume data problems"" or augment human capabilities. Ayasdi's Executive Chairman and co-founder Gurjeet Singh was in January appointed to HSBC's new technology advisory board, which provides advice and guidance to the bank on digital strategy."

As businesses demand more services delivered over the Internet, the titans of technology are stepping up their offerings delivered from data centers afar, so-called cloud computing.I.B.M. made a big move on Tuesday, announcing that it had agreed to buy SoftLayer Technologies, a cloud computing company, in an effort to strengthen its position in the fast-growing market. The purchase price was not disclosed. But it was about $2 billion, according to a person told of the negotiations, who has asked not to be named because he had not been authorized to speak publicly about the terms. The acquisition is the largest made under the leadership of Virginia M. Rometty, who became chief executive in January 2012. The purchase, analysts say, also gives I.B.M. a broader presence in the business of cloud computing services. Amazon is the leader in the public cloud arena, and its roster of customers includes not just start-ups and research projects, but also large companies like Netflix.Amazon does not break out the revenue for its cloud business, Amazon Web Services, but it is growing fast. The unit had estimated revenue of $2 billion last year,  according a recent research report from Barclays, which forecast that Amazon's cloud business would reach $5 billion or more by 2014.I.B.M. executives say its strategy is to compete in the public cloud market not with basic computing capabilities like processing and storage, but with software for marketing, procurement and customer service delivered as cloud offerings. Since 2007, the company has spent $4.5 billion on more than a dozen acquisitions to build up its cloud software and services offerings.''We're focusing on business services that leverage the cloud model,'' said Ric Telford, vice president forI.B.M. cloud services.I.B.M.'s first moves in the cloud market date to 2007. But its early emphasis, analysts say, had mainly been on so-called private clouds, in which the computing is delivered to users as service over the Internet, but from data centers owned by I.B.M.'s corporate customers. But the SoftLayer acquisition will sharply expand I.B.M.'s capability to deliver computing services remotely to customers from I.B.M. data centers -- the so-called public cloud model.SoftLayer, a private company based in Dallas, has a network of 13 data centers in the United States, Singapore and Amsterdam, and revenue of about $400 million a year. GI Partners, a private equity fund based in Menlo Park, Calif., is the majority owner of SoftLayer. The SoftLayer data centers will be added to the 10 cloud services data centers I.B.M. now has worldwide.Erich Clementi, a senior vice president for I.B.M.'s technology services unit, said SoftLayer ''completes our portfolio.'' It expands I.B.M.'s public cloud operations, he said, while adding expertise and technology for private clouds and hybrid services, which blend the public and private models.Lance Crosby, chief executive of SoftLayer, said his company's long-term goal had been to become ''the defacto and most flexible platform for Internet cloud computing. And we couldn't get there on our own.'' I.B.M., he said, has the financial resources and relationships with corporate customers to accelerate the adoption of its cloud technology.Beyond the acquisitions, I.B.M. hopes to offer the company's homegrown technology as cloud services, like its Watson artificial intelligence software, which I.B.M. announced last month was being tailored as a smart customer service assistant.''Watson has a lot more potential because of the cloud delivery model,'' Mr. Telford said.Dannon, the yogurt maker, is a cloud services customer that reflects the I.B.M. strategy. It uses I.B.M. public cloud software for optimizing its pricing, promotions and product planning. The cloud software has helpedDannon's sales planning teams improve the percentage of products sold to consumers to 98 percent from 75percent -- crucial for a food stuff with a limited shelf life. The software was developed by DemandTec, whichI.B.M. acquired last year.In new projects, Dannon, owned by the French company Danone, is now pursuing a ''cloud-first strategy,'' said Timothy Weaver, the chief information officer.I.B.M. has earmarked its cloud business as an area for investment and growth. That business grew 70percent in the first quarter of 2013 from the quarter a year earlier. By 2015, I.B.M. has forecast that its cloud business should reach $7 billion, including private and public cloud services.All the major technology companies -- including Microsoft, EMC, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle -- are pursuing cloud strategies. But analysts say I.B.M., perhaps more than any other company, can assure corporate customers to feel comfortable putting their business information in remote data centers and buying public cloud services.More than a decade ago, I.B.M. demonstrated that endorsement effect, when it made a big commitment to Linux, the open-source operating system, helping it become a mainstream technology in corporate data centers.''I.B.M. is very much a trusted brand here,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst at UBS Securities.

It is intended to give IBM’sdata-analysis business, including its Watson artificial-intelligence technology, broad access to one of the world’s richest data sources — billions of people expressing their interests, wants and worries about every imaginable topic. The goal, according to IBM and Twitter executives, is to enrich business decision-making. “We know what the world is thinking in real time,” said Chris Moody, vice president of data strategy at Twitter. His company’s information resource, he said, should have “nearly limitless applications.”In the future, Mr. Moody predicted, “every significant business decision will have Twitter input.”If so, IBM wants to be the technology vehicle for delivering Twitter-enhanced decisions. Alistair Rennie, general manager for big data and analytics at IBM, called the collaboration with Twitter a “landmark partnership” and one that, by exploiting Twitter’s unique data asset, will open the door to “business decisions based on the pulse of the planet.”The IBM and Twitter executives announced the partnership at a conference on data analysis hosted by IBMin Las Vegas. Later, in a joint interview, Mr. Moody and Mr. Rennie declined to discuss the financial terms of the partnership. But if the companies could achieve their vision of using Twitter to improve business decisions spanning everything from marketing to product development, Mr. Moody said it would be a “great revenue opportunity” for both parties.Most Twitter messages are public. Analysts at IBM and at other companies routinely pore through Twitter traffic for early signals of market trends and consumer sentiment on behalf of corporate clients. And Twitter has increasingly worked with companies and nonprofit researchers. At the conference, Mr. Moody mentioned a project with scientists at Harvard Medical School to study food poisoning by mining Twitter messages. He noted that an unnamed manufacturer of commercial fryers, like those used in fast-food restaurants, found that tweets with the phrase “soggy fries” were an advance sign of equipment malfunctions. Twitter’s work with other companies, Mr. Moody said, will continue. But the IBM partnership, he noted, is in a“new category,” given the breadth of the activities.IBM, Mr. Moody said, will have “full fidelity” access to Twitter data — all public messages and the archives of past messages. The two companies will also jointly develop software tools tailored to business customers, and IBM will train thousands of its consultants to use Twitter data for clients. Knowing how to handle Twitter data in business, Mr. Moody noted, is a “huge gap” for most companies, and the IBM consulting force should help bridge that gap. In the announcement, IBM said it planned first to integrate Twitter data in its cloud-based data analysis services, including Watson Analytics. The two companies will also develop software applications that map customer sentiment for use in sales, marketing and customer service. By incorporating Twitter data into its software, IBM, according to Mr. Rennie, will be able to offer Twitter-enhanced products to large numbers of business customers rather than having each one be a start-from-scratch project. With this partnership, Twitter is the latest well-known company to join with IBM in recent months in fast-growing fields. IBM teamed up with SAP in cloud computing and with apple in data-driven software applications for iPhones and iPads.These partnership deals all come in the context of IBM’s seeking growth in promising new businesses faster than those same emerging technologies erode the sales and profits in the company’s traditional hardware and software lines. Last week, IBM reported disappointing quarterly"
91,63,AIU76,IBM,,,USA,IBM,92052,05-10-2015,Bloomfire,USA,,"Bloomfire announced a partnership with IBM to integrate its Watson cognitive computing system's natural language processing technology with Bloomfire's social knowledge network software. Using Watson's advanced data insights APIs, Bloomfire customers can now automatically tag content to significantly improve users' ability to search and find information. Tagging online content with relevant keywords provides corporate knowledge repositories with critical data that makes searching for information much more effective. Most users of these types of systems neglect to tag their posts and most knowledge management systems lack the functionality to proactively suggest tags, limiting search capabilities. In fact, Bloomfire's own research suggests that properly tagged content is over 50percent more searchable than non-tagged content. This integration will help solve that problem by suggesting keywords and phrases that are related to the content being added.IBM Watson enables organizations to quickly use natural language processing capabilities and data exploration to discover valuable information in both structured and unstructured data. When a Bloomfirecustomer uploads content or a blog post, Watson immediately identifies contextually relevant keywords and phrases for tagging. It then displays those words and phrases to ensure they are appropriate, and the user can modify the tags or simply accept them. With this sophisticated tagging process in place, users are able to search in natural language and instantly retrieve relevant content, expertly culled from a variety of internal data sources. Bloomfire has a diverse customer base that will benefit from this new functionality, including Whole Foods, Dun & Bradstreet and Etsy, among others.""IBM is a pioneer in cognitive computing. By using Watson, we are creating new opportunities to extract a deeper level of information from enterprise applications,"" said Trey Tramonte, president and CEO ofBloomfire.

96,63,AIU80,IBM ,US4592001014,6066,USA,IBM,14593,10-08-2015,Merge Healthcare,USA,,"IBM’s $1 billion purchase of Merge Healthcare should be a boon for the Chicago-based health tech company, giving it greater branding power and deeper pockets to ward off rivals and shape the future of medicine. It also would be a huge payday for Merge Chairman Michael Ferro Jr., who rescued the company from collapse in 2008, and his investment firm, Merrick Ventures. Ferro, on his own and through Chicago-basedMerrick, owned 24 percent of Merge, the company reported in a government filing in May. That would value his stake at nearly $190 million—a more than tenfold return on his $15 million investment in 2008. Ferro also is chairman of Sun-Times owner Wrapports. Merrick stands to gain an additional $15 million as part of an agreement with Merge if the business is sold for at least $1 billion, according to another company filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.“I think over the near term for a company like Merge, where there have been periods of financial uncertainty, having a company like IBM as your new owner really eliminates any concern a hospital or potential customer might have about the company’s long-term viability,” says Matthew Gillmor, an analyst at Robert W. Baird.Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM announced plans Aug. 6 to buy Merge in a deal worth $1 billion. IBM would assume$207.6 million in Merge debt, according to William Blair analyst Ryan Daniels. The tech services and software giant had $92.8 billion in revenue last year. In April, IBM launched the Watson Health Cloud, a trove of more than 315 billion data files, from doctors’notes and archives of patient medical records to clinical trials and research. The idea is to help doctors and other health care providers find patterns, like how a tumor has changed over time, and determine the best treatment options for their patients. But Watson’s data was limited to text files. Buying Merge, which helps providers store and exchange medical images such as X-rays and MRIs that are too large to email easily, would allow Watson to “see” and add a“considerable inventory in the billions” of images, says Stephen Gold, vice president of Watson Health.“Merge is right in the sweet spot of medical images and the handling of medical images,” he says. “When we looked at what was perhaps one of the most unique opportunities to drive value . . . Merge quickly rises to the top.”Ferro, who rejoined Merge’s board last year as chairman after resigning in 2013, says that he was beginning to build technology with machine-learning capability that would enable Merge to not only manage and store images but also read them, helping doctors speed detection and diagnosis. Merge, which has roughly 800 employees, has one of the largest nongovernment databases, with 30 billion images. IBM’s supercomputing capabilities, which it is selling to customers on demand under the Watson brand in a big-data play, are legendary. “This is going to be a big deal,” Ferro says.“Ninety percent of the health care data is in imaging,” he says. “With the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence, we can take the different data sources—health records, imaging and genomics—and do predictive modeling to help you have a longer, better life.”"

It was like a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup. They had the peanut butter, and we had the chocolate. We each had what both of us needed.”IBM’s top research executive, John Kelly, invited Ferro to another Watson lab in New York. “He started showing me what they wanted to do with health care,” Ferro says. “It was pretty cool. They’ve been working on it for years. We have health care expertise and algorithms. What we needed was their Watson cognitive computing power, which they were testing with imaging.”IBM says it plans to keep Merge’s operations in Chicago and Wisconsin, where it employs about 200. Goldsays Merge’s management team also would remain, including CEO Justin Dearborn, who took over two years ago. The real value of the company is the people and their expertise, he says.“We will invest and grow those resources,” Gold says of Merge. “They will become an ancillary site that we will look to capitalize and build out and build upon.”IBM likely will acquire more health care companies as it looks to be a leader in the fast-paced transformation of health care, says Steve Conway, an analyst at International Data. “The idea is to produce good outcomes for the individual (patient), and it really is very personalized,” Conway says. Merge has attempted to sell itself before. In 2012, the company hired an investment banking firm to shop it around, but it took itself off the market in 2013. The IBM deal is expected to be completed this year. This would be IBM’s second $1 billion acquisition of a Chicago tech company. It bought SPSS in 2009."

105,68,AIU87,Intel,US4581401001,6008,USA,INTC,14542,10-08-2016,Nervana Systems,USA,,"Intel Corp. to intensify its efforts in a hot new computing market, is taking the unusual step of relying on technology developed by a startup it acquired.The chip maker, determined to counter rival Nvidia Corp.'s lead in the field known as deep learning, said it would begin shipping chips in 2017 that it acquired through its purchase earlier this year of startup NervanaSystems. Intel said it plans to integrate Nervana chips and software with its general-purpose Xeonmicroprocessors, which are used in most corporate data centers. Deep learning is a fast-growing branch of the broader field called artificial intelligence, which refers to systems that train themselves by analyzing large sets of data rather than being programmed in conventional ways. Companies such as Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are widely using deep-learning techniques to improve computers' ability to identify speech and objects in images, among other tasks. Many companies now carry out those chores using a combination of Intel Xeon chips and Nvidia chips called GPUs, for graphics processing units. Intel, though it didn't mention Nvidia by name, said it expects the Nervana technology will allow it to train deep-learning systems 100 times faster than with a GPU.""The GPU architecture does not have a unique advantage for AI,"" said Brian Krzanich, Intel's chief executive, at a San Francisco gathering focused on the technology. ""It's not the only solution that is out there.""Intel and others are placing multiple technology bets in the field. Besides GPUs, companies such as Microsoft are also using chips known as field programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, for deep-learning applications. Intel jumped on that trend by buying Altera Corp., the biggest FPGA maker, in its biggest-ever transaction. In addition to Nervana, Intel in September cut a deal to buy Movidius Ltd., another startup that specializes in vision-related applications of deep learning. Intel is looking to diversify from its longtime stronghold in chips for personal computers, a market that has been slowing lately. Mr. Krzanich has been pushing the company into new fields, including wearable technology, drones and other connected devices known by the phrase the Internet of Things, or IoT. He predicted deep learning will become much more widely used -- not just in data centers, but to sift through the information generated by connected devices. ""Without some form of artificial intelligence,"" such devices will only generate noise, Mr. Krzanich said. Intel also announced a relationship with Google to collaborate on software and other technology for the search firm's cloud service. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, termed Intel's announcements impressive but noted that rivals such as Nvidia will have their own countermoves.

""Earning co-sell ready status with Microsoft is a tremendous opportunity for Cerebri AI as our ConcurrentAdvanced Reinforcement Learning software is a perfect pairing with Azure,"" said Jean Belanger, Cerebri AICo-founder & CEO. ""We look forward to collaborating closely with the OCP team globally to bring even more value to their Fortune 500 accounts.""As a key element of Microsoft's go-to-market strategy, partnering with a select group of independent software vendors (ISVs) to accelerate Azure adoption has proven extremely effective. In their most recent fiscal quarter Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue increased 48 percent year-over-year to $9 billion. Their industry-leading IP co-sell program which rewards 40,000 Microsoft sellers for selling third-party solutions is a""runaway success"" according to Gavriella Schuster, Microsoft Corporate Vice President, One CommercialPartner. The co-sell program Cerebri AI is joining generated $8 billion in contracted revenue since its launch in July 2017. According to Schuster, ""Our partners are reaping the benefits and seeing co-sell deals close nearly three times faster, projects that are nearly six times larger, and drive six times more Azureconsumption.""Traditional top-down approaches to sales, marketing and brand management stop short of considering each individual customer's unique journey. Using cloud computing, Cerebri AI applies advanced machine-learning models to massive customer data sets and builds from the bottom up, with one customer journey measuring commitment to the brand, in real time, across channels, and at scale. Given a specific KPI, the Cerebri software predicts which customers are most likely to act to meet that KPI and when; and what action must betake now based on their current commitment to the brand and their overall customer journey. Cerebri AI runs on Microsoft Azure on a SaaS basis behind corporate firewalls, ensuring maximum security and quality for both the data inputs and the next best actions generated by the machine-learning models. Companies that license the Cerebri AI software acquire a powerful automated tool for dynamically monitoring not only brand value, but also identifying next best actions that accelerate growth while simultaneously reducing costs. A UK-based nationwide automotive retailer recently achieved 7x their baseline conversion to sales results using a Cerebri AI email campaign, which had the additional benefit of reducing the total number of emails sent by 90% — an increasingly important consideration in the GDPR era"

123,81,AIU105,Microsoft,,,USA,MSFT,14542,20-12-2018,ZestFinance,USA,,"Microsoft said Wednesday that it is entering a strategic partnership with financial technology startup ZestFinance to make it easier for its financial services customers to adopt AI and machine learning tools. The software giant provides different tools used by financial institutions that range from cloud services to Office. The partnership will integrate ZestFinances artificial intelligence tools with Microsoft products like its azure cloud computing service. Were working with them closely around banking and fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and how they can use AI and deep learning, Ed Fandrey, Microsofts vice president for financial services, U.S., says. For Microsoft, what Zest brings to the table is explainability. Data scientists and researchers are often able to develop sophisticated models for a number of financial applications. However, even when those models produce good results, it's not always clear how the models arrived at them. This makes them something of a black box, which isn't useful for highly regulated industries like banking. The fact is, we haven't had the ability to use some of the most advanced deep learning models because of the explainability problem, said David Berglund, senior vice president of artificial intelligence at U.S. Bank, which is not a Zest customer. The answer we get with deep learning might be accurate, but in the case of credit applications, that isn't enough.Douglas Merrill, CEO of ZestFinance, said the company's approach draws heavily from an open-source technique called SHAP  which is based on game theory work done in the1970s by mathematician Lloyd Shapley. That work has since been used by AI researchers to find transparent ways to determine how algorithms make decisions. What Zest does is to take that technique and apply it to financial underwriting so financial institutions can understand why the machine learning model said yes to one credit application and no to another. Our version is designed to satisfy the regulatory and risk management requirements in financial services, Merrill says. The startup has believers. In 2017, Ford partnered with Zest to improve credit risk modeling for auto lending. The company also received a strategic investment of $30 million in 2016 from Baidu, giving the company a$252 million valuations, according to Pitchbook. That investment was geared towards developing ways to improve credit scoring in China. Ultimately, Merrill wants his company and its machine learning techniques to make a big upgrade to the way credit decisions are made, compared to current ways of modeling credit that are decades old. We want to make fair and transparent credit available to everyone, he said"

Microsoft first announced Dynamics 365 this summer and unveiled more details on its combined CRM and ERP service on Tuesday, announcing that the first components of Dynamics 365 will begin rolling out November 1. Hosted on the Microsoft Azure cloud, Dynamics 365 is a suite of business applications for sales, marketing and customer service. Seven initial applications will be released next month in more than 135 markets and in40 different languages, Microsoft revealed in a blog post announcing the news. Microsoft has effectively bundled a variety of separate products into a single platform, with a foundation of artificial intelligence. Two features in particular involve data intelligence: Customer Insights and Relationship Insights. CustomerInsights enables users to integrate data from internal and third-party sources to power marketing and sales automated workflows and hosts data from external partners like Facebook and Trip Advisor. Built on Microsoft's Cortana Intelligence Suite, Relationship Insights provides users with customer relationship status updates in real-time. Users of Microsoft's Dynamics 365 will soon be able to leverage Versium's predictive automated solution, Versium Predict, to improve lead generation performance as well. Versium powers LifeData, a database of more than 1 trillion consumer and business data attributes, ranging across both online and offline behavior. These data characteristics, such as demographic or financial information, are then matched to a company's internal data and applied with machine-learning algorithms to improve customer acquisition and retention. The Microsoft integration will apply the LifeData database to customer data already available in Dynamics365, allowing users to construct predictive models to create new, data-driven and targeted prospect lists of those who are most likely to engage and/or purchase.

The Redmond, Wash-based company announced Monday that it was buying virtual-assistant start-up Geneefor an undisclosed sum, according to blog posts by Microsoft and Genee executives. The move comes on the heels of Microsoft's $26 billion purchase of professional networking site LinkedIn, a bold chess move by CEO Satya Nadella as he aims to make his company's cloud-based Office 365 platform ubiquitous in the business environment. Genee makes software that uses artificial intelligence to schedule appointments. Emailing a contact and copying Genee causes the software to interpret the sender's meeting request, search through the sender's calendar and suggest a few meeting times to the recipient. ""Genee uses natural language processing and optimized decision-making algorithms so that interacting with a virtual assistant is just like interacting with a human one,"" wrote Rajesh Jha, Microsoft's corporate vice president in charge of Outlook and Office 365. The Mountain View, Calif. -based company was founded in 2014 by Ben Cheung and Charles Lee, who had raised $1. 4 million from investors, according to Crunchbase.

Genee's service echoes that of San Francisco-based Clara, which also allows clients to schedule meetings via email. The artificial intelligence space is heating up, as start-ups and large companies such as Apple, Google and Amazon beef up their efforts to create ""bots"" that can take over tasks through their understanding of written and spoken language. As humans increasingly ask machines to do their bidding -- whether scheduling meetings via Genee and Clara or ordering detergent through Amazon Echo's Alexa -- privacy advocates are raising flags about how companies collecting such data might be able to create detailed databases of consumer habits and preferences.Last week, the Electronic Frontier Foundation took Microsoft to task for both the persistent way in which it pushed Windows users to perform a free upgrade to Windows 10 (part of the company's strategy to hit 1billion users by 2018) as well as what the EFF felt was suspect in the way iWindows 10 users were having their data archived when opting into searches using Microsoft's virtual assistant, Cortana.""Windows 10 sends an unprecedented amount of usage data back to Microsoft, particularly if users opt into 'personalize' the software using Cortana,"" wrote the EFF's Amul Kalia. ""Here's a non-exhaustive list of data sent back: location data, text input, voice input, touch input, webpages you visit, and telemetry data regarding your general usage of your computer, including which programs you run and for how long. Kalia went on to write that while ""we understand that many users find features like Cortana useful, and that such features would be difficult (though not necessarily impossible) to implement in a way that doesn't send data back to the cloud, the fact remains that many users would much prefer not to use these features in exchange for maintaining their privacy. ""The struggle between data privacy and pure convenience will continue to loom large as machines increasingly take over more menial tasks. Researchers at Cornell Tech, Google and Microsoft are working on ways to create ""privacy-preserving deep learning"" algorithms that in theory would allow machines to get smarter by digesting endless data while at the same time keeping the source of such information anonymous."

146,91,AIU126,Omnicom,US6819191064,4066,USA,OMC,30681,29-07-2013,Publicis,USA,,"Advertising giants Omnicom and Publicis said Sunday they had agreed to merge, in a $35.1 billion cross-border linkup that shows how Big Data is making Madison Avenue look more like Wall Street. The combination of Omnicom Group of the U.S. and France's Publicis Groupe SA is aimed at restoring the balance of power between advertising agencies and such Silicon Valley companies as Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. About 22% of global ad spending now is digital, according to eMarketer, a share projected to grow to 27% by 2017. Omnicom and Publicis hope that by joining forces, they will be better equipped for an industry increasingly dominated by data-driven analysis and automated trading of ad space.  The market for automated buying of space is relatively small, but fast growing. According to eMarketer, U.S.advertisers will spend $3.4 billion on real-time bidding in 2013, mostly in online display ads.""Digital buying of media is done by machines, as if you're standing on the floor of the Nasdaq as opposed to traditional media shop,"" Omnicom's chief executive, John Wren, told analysts earlier this month. ""I hold the long-term belief that eventually traditional media, or a lot of traditional media, will get purchased that way."" Mr. Wren and Publicis Chief Executive Maurice Levy are to be co-CEOs for 30 months, after which Mr. Levy, who initiated the talks, is slated to become non executive chairman and Mr. Wren to continue as CEO, the companies said. Mr. Levy is 71 years old and Mr. Wren is 60.To be called Publicis Omnicom Group, the new company would have combined revenue of nearly $23 billion, based on 2012 figures for each, overtaking WPP Group PLC's GBP 10.37 billion ($15.95 billion) revenue posted last year. The merger partners' combined stock market value as of Friday was $35.1 billion. The hope is to close the deal in the fourth quarter of 2013 or first quarter of 2014, though it could face antitrust scrutiny. The combination would bring some of Madison Avenue's best-known advertising agencies under one roof. Omnicom, whose agencies include BBDO, TBWA Worldwide and media buyer OMD, works for advertisers such as McDonald's Corp. and PepsiCo Inc. Publicis owns Leo Burnett and Saatchi & Saatchi as well as media-buying firm Starcom MediaVest and digital agencies such as Razorfish. Its clients include L'Oreal SA, Procter & Gamble Co. and Renault SA. Of the growing portion of global ad spending that is digital, the money flows disproportionately to Google, which not only sells online search ads but runs an automated marketplace for buying online ads, and to Facebook, which has a vast audience and plenty of user data. With revenue three times that of WPP last year, Google is a formidable competitor for ad agencies, particularly in an industry where data collection has assumed greater importance. Firms such as Salesforce.com and Adobe Systems Inc. are also moving more deeply into the industry, posing new competition for ad agencies. ""All of these tech players didn't exist, didn't compete, even on the fringes of our business, even five years ago,"" Omnicom's Mr. Wren said in an interview. The merger, he said, will ""create a lot of opportunities for us, some defensive and some offensive.""Advertisers use data to better aim their ads at certain demographic groups, taking into account people'sInternet surfing behavior or purchasing habits. To do this efficiently requires access to huge amounts of data, where Google has a head start.""It's trillions of data that we have to crunch down in order to go down to very small segments or clusters of thepopulation to deliver some single messages to very the population of individuals,"" Mr. Levy said in an interview.""For that we need scale.""In a statement disclosing the deal, the Publicis CEO noted that ""the communication and marketing landscapehas undergone dramatic changes in recent year landscape has the exponential development of new mediagiants, the explosion of Big Data, blurring of media giants all players and profound changes in consumerbehavior.""He said the partners hope their com consumer behavior fit clients ""by bringing together the most comprehensiveoffering of analog and digital services.comprehensive offerings with RBC Capital Markets, said, ""The bigger an ad agency is, the more likely they are to have more access to consumer data and data around the pricing of online ad impressions,"" which helps them get the best price when buying from ""digital behemoths like Google and Facebook.""Meanwhile, an increasing portion of ads is being bought and sold on automated exchanges, known as""programmatic buying,"" rather than through Madison Avenue media-buying firms that rely on relationships between media sales executives and ad buyers. While ad firms have set up their own automated trading desks, they face lots of competition. Some advertisers, such as Kellogg Co., use independent providers instead of agency-owned trading desks. Alternatively, advertisers can go straight to Google, which owns DoubleClick Bid Manager -- previously calledInvite Media -- a system that allows advertisers to buy ad space across the web. To compete, ad companies have invested heavily in building systems that play in this arena and data that help improve their buying. Maintaining and updating the systems can be expensive.""With an integrated data and automated buying operation, the combined scale of Publicis and Omnicom would be better-positioned to compete against traditional agency competitors as well as nontraditional competitors like Google,"" said Rajeev Goel, CEO at PubMatic Inc., a tech company that helps website owners manage and sell ad space. Data analysis is even playing a role in shaping of ads themselves. Last year, Samsung Electronics Co. minedTwitter for critical comments about the launch of Apple Inc.'s new iPhone and used them to shape its ads. All the major ad-agency holding companies in recent years have been snapping up data scientists and engineers.""There has been a huge shift in the way we do business,"" said Jonathan Nelson, chief executive ofOmnicom's digital business, in a recent interview. ""We are borrowing black-box trading techniques out of WallStreet; we are looking at genetic algorithms; we are looking at artificial intelligence; we are looking at predictive models; we are looking for anything that might give marketers an edge.""In January, Omnicom hired Amit Bhattacharyya as a data scientist at its data and analytics company, Annalect. His background includes helping build a particle detector on a NASA-funded experiment during graduate studies and working as a quantitative analyst on Wall Street.""When I was young, I thought I'd be an astronaut or a physics professor,"" he said. He was drawn to advertising by the bigger role played by data. The Annalect unit has about 200 data scientists and programmers on staff, Omnicom says. Publicis also has hired many of these types of experts. The deal comes as companies increasingly squeeze down their costs for ad services, in some cases by delaying payments to agencies. The merger could give the ad companies more power to fight back.""This consolidation could be favorable for profit margins at the holding companies because it reduces the competition when services are priced for clients,"" said Brian Wieser, of Pivotal Research Group"

200,135,AIU172,"Veritone, Inc.",,,USA,VERI,16712,15-08-2019,ART19,USA,,"Veritone, Inc., the creator of the world's first operating system for artificial intelligence,aiWARE(TM), today announced an agreement with ART19, a leading podcast hosting, content management, monetization, and measurement platform. ART19 will use aiWARE to run cognitive analysis and topical extraction on publisher podcasts that are part of ART19's targeted ad sales platform, making it possible forART19's advertising partners to target ads based on the content of an individual podcast episode.""ART19 knows podcast advertising works. And advertisers know that ads can be incredibly successful if they're reaching the right listeners at the right time,"" said Lex Friedman, chief revenue officer at ART19. ""By adding aiWARE to our platform, we're empowering buyers to target ads to consumers based on the content of the episode they're listening to. Listeners appreciate contextual and relevant ads -- and that means they pay more attention to them.""ART19 will integrate aiWARE's transcription and topic analysis capabilities to enhance its targeted marketplace. The ART19 sales team will then be able to place contextually relevant advertisements within the podcast based on its subject matter. Programmatic digital audio ad serving generally allows advertisers to reach users based on a combination of targetable attributes derived from first-party and third-party user data. ART19 will use aiWARE to identify the topics discussed in a podcast episode, enabling the digital audio ad server to target or exclude ads based not only on who is listening to the content, but on the topical taxonomy of that content. Now, for example, a financial services firm can target ads to be played in podcast episodes that are discussing personal finance and are being listened to by 25- to34-year-olds. Conversely, aiWARE can also support brand safety use cases, in which an advertiser requests that its ads be excluded from any podcast episodes that discuss controversial topics. Before aiWARE, there was no way for ART19's employees to analyze and categorize topical metadata efficiently across thousands of podcast episodes. Now, with aiWARE's topical extraction capabilities, ART19can automate this workflow and pass the metadata to the ad server, which will automatically include or exclude ads based on rule sets.""We're always looking for powerful tools that benefit everyone in our ecosystem to keep pushing podcasting forward -- for publishers, advertisers, and listeners alike,"" Friedman added. ""aiWARE will lead to contextually relevant ads, which will serve publishers well in terms of revenue; yield great results for advertisers; and provide listeners with ads that feel native, custom, and in line with their interests.""Unlike a single-point solution that solves only one use case, aiWARE affords ART19 a true AI operating system that makes its investment in AI future-proof. The aiWARE platform's open architecture allows ART19to integrate cognition from multiple machine learning algorithms into its existing technology stack seamlessly and to add more cognitive categories easily as new needs arise. aiWARE enables ad-tech capabilities within audio and video formats that were previously impractical because they exceeded the capacity and financial resources of human workforces. In a parallel to Google'sindexing of websites, Veritone's aiWARE automates the systematic indexing and contextual extraction of hundreds of thousands of hours of audio and video content to enable new targeting and brand safety workflows,"" said Veritone President Ryan Steelberg. ""ART19's deployment shows how refined targeting capabilities can deliver more efficiency for advertisers with a higher ROI on ad spend, all while creating abetter listener experience."

203,136,AIE28,Visa,US92826C8394,179534,USA,V,92611,03-10-2013,UKplc,UK,,"Global payments technology company, Visa and @UKplc, one of the United Kingdom's largest eCommerce marketplace solutions providers, today jointly announced a partnership that will position and deliver effective cost management for Governments and Enterprises in the region. The partnership will launch a cloud-based, advanced e-procurement system that extends the capabilities of existing procure-to-pay products, into business planning and improving interaction between buyers and their suppliers.cloudBuy is an integrated solution that takes a corporate buyer through a procurement process, from sourcing, order placement, payment, through to analyzing the purchase from a cost management standpoint, in a few mouse clicks. The solution then takes the process further with in-built controls and immediate audit facilities, eliminating rogue buying and off-contract pricing as well as ensuring compliance.cloudBuy has an exclusive partnership with Visa, which offers a safe and controlled payment environment. The payment method also ensures that buyer organizations do not lapse on payment schedules with their suppliers and that suppliers have better cash flow with shorter payment periods. The payment method will particularly benefit SME suppliers who often suffer cash flow problems because of payment delays by buyers.""Economic forecasts in Asia Pacific markets, particularly the more developed ones, have called for austerity measures. We acknowledge that organizations are under pressure to cut costs and improve efficiencies quickly. They are looking for solutions that are not just quick fixes but provide sustainable cost management possibilities,"" said Olivia Leong, Regional Head of Enterprise & Government Payment Solutions, CommercialProducts, Visa, Asia Pacific, Central Europe, Middle East and Africa.""We decided to extend Visa's collaboration with @UKplc that started in Europe, to Asia Pacific. ThroughcloudBuy, we bring to market an enhanced electronic procure-to-pay solution that doesn't just provide immediate cost savings, but will push companies to reassess their buying behaviors and payment methods to meet long-term cost management objectives,"" Leong added. Visa says that the partnership combines the strengths of the company's issuer relationships, a proven network and a track record of bringing innovative payment solutions to the market, with @UKplc's experience in developing and running e-commerce and cloud computing solutions for Government and corporate clients.cloudBuy -- Going Beyond Procure-to-PayA key differentiator of cloudBuy is its starting point. The system operates on artificial intelligence technology that analyses a buying organization's spend detail in just days. It gives an immediate assessment of compliance to raising purchase orders, price variances for the same product across the organization locally and globally, lost opportunities with volume discounts and special promotions, as well as a global price benchmark for the same product. The data and analysis will assist buying organizations to set realistic cost management targets even before cloudBuy is implemented. Upon implementation, cloudBuy continues to offer data analysis that produces extensive reports that assist organizations with supplier management, contract negotiations and renegotiations, as well as real time tracking of cost management leading to better business forecasting.""We have at hand the intelligence of having analyzed more than $500 billion of spend through ourSpendInsight tool,"" said Lyn Duncan, CEO, UKplc. ""cloudBuy's client base will benefit from the knowledge gained from @UKplc's experience in analyzing corporate buying behavior as well as price variances across the globe. We remain steadfastly committed to helping organizations improve purchasing processes and achieving their strategic business goals.""Working with Visa, we have been challenged to bring to market a technological solution that is easy to implement and use. Buying organizations need not deal with high up-front investments and complicated set-up procedures. There will be a minimum training requirement for administrators and users.""Using the system is intuitive as it has been modeled to be an eCommerce site for corporate purchases. So anyone who is capable of online shopping through an amazon.com or Travelocity will breeze throughcloudBuy. This ensures that the adoption rate is higher and organizations will see the benefits of implementation much faster,"" said Duncan.cloudBuy for SuppliersAnother e-commerce influence that buyers can see on cloudBuy is its catalogue management system. Typically in e-procurement systems, catalogue management resides with buying organizations that have to manually load suppliers' spreadsheet catalogues into their portals. This results in extra work for buyers and suppliers as well as out-of-date content and a limited ability to deal with services and more complex products.cloudBuy enables suppliers to manage their own content. Suppliers are provided with a B2B website which enables them to manage their catalogue of goods or services, time based booking, pricing and discount structures, inform buyers of delivery charges, stock levels, as well as tax and currency. If suppliers maintain their own websites, cloudBuy can work with them to make those sites interoperable with the buyer's cloudBuyportal.This is a significant step forward from a supplier standpoint as the website structure allows for them to promote their products and services at the right price, ensuring availability, and eliminating hidden costs for buyers, significantly reducing the possibility of disagreement on final purchase prices.cloudBuy will be first launched in Australia in late 2013. Other markets earmarked for first phase launch include New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong."

Adam Cahan, a senior vice president at Yahoo, said on the company's blog that the app would be shut down so that its three-person team, including founder Nick D'Aloisio, can incorporate its features into existing Yahoo products. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. A person familiar with the matter said the purchase price was greater than $10 million. A Yahoo spokeswoman declined to comment. Summly, which didn't generate revenue, summarizes news articles, ""giving you a simple and elegant way to find the news you want"" while helping publishers ""drive interest in stories and reach a generation of mobile users that want information on the go,"" Mr. Cahan said. Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has said the company is looking to create services for mobile devices that fit into people's ""daily habits."" She said she is focused on increasing the amount of time people spend on Yahoo, which in time will lead to greater revenue. Yahoo has made a handful of other acquisitions in recent months, including the teams behind mobile appStamped and news-reading site Snip.it. The company also is in talks to buy a controlling stake in FranceTelecom SA's online-video site Dailymotion, according to people familiar with the talks, in what would be Ms.Mayer's first major acquisition since taking over the Internet pioneer last year. In an interview on Monday, Mr. D'Aloisio, who is 17 years old, said the Summly app was downloaded more than 750,000 times and showed that providing people with ""snippets"" about news articles can increase the rate at which people view full articles. He said he was attracted to Yahoo because of its ""scale"" and Ms.Mayer's ""real focus to beautify content when you're on a mobile device.""Mr. D'Aloisio founded his company when he was 15 and created Trimit, a predecessor to Summly, in 2011. He redesigned the app and relaunched it as Summly in late 2012 with funding from Zynga Inc. CEO MarkPincus and the investment firm owned by Hong Kong business mogul Li Ka-shing, which ""contacted me out of the blue"" after Trimit began to receive accolades. He said he raised a total of $1.5 million. Yahoo's Mr. Cahan said in an interview Monday that Mr. D'Aloisio was an ""exceptional"" talent and that Yahoo did ""extensive"" testing of Summly's algorithm, or mathematical formula, for condensing news articles. The app's technology was developed with the aid of SRI International, an artificial-intelligence lab in SiliconValley that also worked on Siri, a voice assistant that was acquired by Apple Inc. Mr. Cahan said SRI had an ownership stake in Mr. D'Aloisio's company. The move by Yahoo into news-reading technology for mobile devices comes less than a year after the company shut down its Livestand app, which it created in 2011 to compete with companies such as Flipboard Inc. and Alphonso Labs Inc., the maker of the Pulse app."

Simply put, the main product of Wander, Days app is a visual diary that lets you capture and share your whole day at once (in just a few photos a day). Earlier this year, Yahoo! had announced the acquisition of Aviate that automatically organizes apps in your smartphone home-screen, and gets to information faster than ever. Co-founder of Wander, Jeremy Fisher wrote on his blog-""We've spent the past few years figuring out how to make content creation as habitual as content consumption. That's the idea behind Days, the daily visual diary we launched in May 2013. Nine months later, we're excited to announce that we've accepted an offer to bring our work on daily habits to Yahoo. We started our company with the vision of transforming daily habits, and we're proud to be joining a new one that shares that mission.""The blog post on company's website also clarifies the current status of the 5-member team, ""Our entire team will be joining Yahoo's NYC-based Mobile and EmergingProducts group, where we'll continue on as a startup team within a larger organization. The Days app will live on as a standalone entity, and we'll also be working on some exciting new projects that we can't talk about just yet.""Wander had raised $1.2 million in April 2012. The app was launched to give a tumblr experience to the users by clicking photos and make content swiftly. It gamifies the photo experience with the help of gifs which can act as a feed or slideshow of images to describe your day. At first look, the app seems to be a good engagement tool for celebrities and brands justified by the craze in people to know how they spend their day (through images). In general, it cuts down on a lot of irrelevant content used to share an experience through blogs as images can connect to the audience more than the content. Wander creates a wanderlog, which is where one can capture experiences like adventures, a guide to a town, favorite works of street art or simply the places one loves. This in turns helps to make a network connecting places, posts and experiences bringing together wanderers with shared interests. What Yahoo! gets from the deal With Instagram and Snapchat, photo content is on the rise and Wander has as a team behind an app, which gives Yahoo! an insight into how people spend their day through the medium of photographs clicked throughout the day. Besides talent acquisition, this deal will support the artificial intelligence study with the data on human interactions. Acquisition of Aviate and Wander are in sync with Marissa Mayer's announcement in the beginning of this year, ""Think about how much your phone understands about you - your contacts, calendar, emails and images - and what happens when that context becomes part of the search experience. The future of search is contextual knowledge, and we are investing in the future.""It would be interesting to see how Yahoo!'s Tumblr evolves with these acquisitions."

The move signals Microsoft's continued determination to remain a player in mobile devices - despite market share for its Windows Phones dipping to around one per cent in the last quarter of 2015.SwiftKey is widely regarded as the best virtual keyboard available for mobile devices, with its predictive text capabilities also integrated into the keyboard on BlackBerry 10. The company's technology is able to tap users' Gmail accounts in order to learn their writing style. SwiftKey's latest technology is based on neural network artificial intelligence, which it applied to the predictive text in a recently launched Android keyboard. The developers behind SwiftKey will join Microsoft's research unit. The company was founded in 2008 by co-founders Jon Reynolds and Ben Medlock, currently CEO and chief technology officer respectively. The company has raised more than $20m in venture capital from Accel Partners, Index Ventures and OctopusInvestments, among others, who will no doubt have been keen to cash out given the sum Microsoft was offering. The company has its head office in London, as well as offices in San Francisco and Seoul, and ""people in India and China"".""We love SwiftKey's technology and we love the team that Jon and Ben have formed,"" said Harry Shum, head of Microsoft Research.

Its artificial intelligence technology, for example, could be applied to Cortana to help it better understand users.SwiftKey, incidentally, is also an Amazon Web Services (AWS) user - a corporate case study, no less - and it will, presumably, be shifting to Microsoft Azure. The cloud compute is required for SwiftKey to analyse and refine the service for users.""We collect and analyse tens of terabytes of web-crawled data to create language models and build cloud services, like personalisation, for millions of active users.

Magic Pony uses machine learning, a way of teaching software to perform tasks without explicit programming instructions based on pattern recognition, a technology that's ""increasingly at the core of everything we build at Twitter,"" Dorsey said.Twitter paid about US$150 million for Magic Pony, according to a person familiar with the matter. The terms of the deal were previously reported by Tech Crunch.Magic Pony's technology uses artificial intelligence for visual effects. It can be used to clean up pixelated images or create new images. It can be used to improve video streaming - especially in environments where bandwidth and connectivity isn't ideal - or to automatically build landscapes for computer games. The company, created in 2014 by graduates from Imperial College London with backgrounds in computer vision, mathematics and neuroscience, trains neural networks to process visual information. The network can be taught to learn what a high-quality image looks like when converted to a lower-quality image and then can reverse this process, taking poor-quality images and turning them into high-quality. Magic Pony's technology can do this using a standard graphics processor, meaning it could be used by all sorts of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones. Before the Twitter acquisition, Magic Pony was backed by 4.3-million pounds (US$6.31 million) in funding , according to public filings, including from London-based Octopus Ventures. London venture firm BaldertonCapital also was a backer. The company was valued at 21-million pounds in its last financing round in May2016.

The deal marks Apple’s third acquisition of a UK company this year. Its technology could help Appleto improve Siri, its virtual assistant, as well as further the iPhone maker’s automotive ambitions. While VocalIQ’s speech processing and machine learning technology could be incorporated into devices from wearables to the connected home, the company was particularly focused on in-car applications. This included a collaboration with General Motors.In a blog earlier this year, VocalIQ described how a “conversational voice-dialog system” in a car’s navigation system could prevent drivers from becoming distracted by looking at screens. Its “self-learning” technology allows “real conversation between human and the internet of things”, VocalIQ wrote. This would improve on virtual assistants such as Siri, Google Now, Microsoft’s Cortana and Amazon’s Alexa, which rely on scripted interactions and can respond only to particular commands.In another blog, VocalIQ said existing assistants have fallen “well short of consumer expectations”, singling out Siri as a mere “toy”.VocalIQ, which was spun out of the University of Cambridge’s Dialogue Systems Group, uses deep learning to improve language recognition, with a focus on trying to understand the context in which commands are given. The company is led by chief executive Blaise Thomson, a South Africa-born mathematician, and chairmanSteve Young, a professor of Information Engineering at Cambridge.

Entering the European healthcare market is the next paramount step for RXB, stated Evan M. Levine, CEO ofRXB Healthcare. We believe that SPR offers us the best and most expedient opportunity to accomplish this.""EU and Global EHR Market FactsIn 2014, the European electronic health records (EHR) market earned $2.74 billion. This market is expected to grow and reach $3.69 billion by 2020.1The European Commission has indicated that it wants to boost the digital economy by enabling all Europeans to have access to online medical records anywhere in Europe by 2020 by enabling citizens` secure, cross-border access to their electronic health records and the possibility of sharing their records across borders; and by providing digital tools that enable citizens to manage their health more actively within integrated care systems.The EUs goals are reasonably based, with a surge of global adoption of personal health records (PHRs)currently underway. Researchers have forecasted that the adoption of PHRs will increase to the point where 75%of adults will use a PHR by 2020. Dual-Market, Dual App Strategy: USA and EUBased on extensive research, the RXB Healthcare team has concluded that it was prudent not to deploy aPHR app built for US markets in Europe. Acquiring SPR gives RXB Healthcare an established platform. Healthcare interoperability varies by region, leading RXB to focus on a dual-market, dual-app strategy, however both will fit under a single business strategy. One crossover will be that all data collected by established SPR applications will be stored on the RXB Data MainframeTM, and subject to appropriate European compliance and data protection regulations.In the US, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act was signed into law in 2009. Its implementation was to promote the adoption and meaningful use of health information technology.Other constraints within the US market include integration requirements with regards to EMRs, EHRs, HIEsas well as privacy and security constraints through compliance with the Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. Going forward, RXB Healthcare will proceed with two different apps for two different continental market strategies, all under one underlying personal health record business strategy, stated James Brooks President and Chief Operating Officer of RXB Healthcare.

Spectral Edge’s website, as well as all of its social media accounts, have also been taken down.Neither Apple nor Spectral Edge responded to a request for comment.Founded in 2014 by researchers at the University of East Anglia, Spectral Edge developed a form of machine learning that can improve photographs in real-time. It achieves this by combining images captured by a standard camera lens with data from an infrared shot, which has the effect of significantly improving the depth of colour of an image.“It’s bringing extra detail into the picture that you can’t necessarily see with a normal camera, because infrared penetrates through mist and fog much better than visible light,” Spectral Edge’s managing director Christopher Cytera said in a 2016 interview with TechCrunch. “The secret sauce is being able to combine thei nfrared with the visible light picture in a way that’s pleasing.

298,54,AIE114,Google,US02079K1079,160329,USA,GOOG,14542,14-01-2014,Nest,UK,,"Google’s $3.2 billion acquisition of Nest, a company that specialises in building sleekly designed,internet-connected products for the home, has sent shockwaves through the tech community - and for good reason. Last week’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas showed that the ‘internet of things’  is going to be a big deal in years to come, with Cisco CEO JohnChambers predicting that the market will be worth $19 trillion by 2020. But despite this hype, most of the products showcased so far don’t hold much attraction for the casual consumer. Do you really want a washing machine that can text you? Or a fridge you can take calls on? Nest’s brilliance is that it cuts through this confusion, creating technologies that have been hailed for their ease-of-use, attractive design, and for actually solving problems rather than creating them. They've only release two products so far, but both have been extremely well received. The Nest thermostat (only on sale in the US and Canda) learns users' habits - you set it manually a few times and it will pick up and automate temperature changes depending on your routine - whilst the Protect smoke-detector takes some obvious steps forward by being easy to turn off (you can wave your hand at it), connecting up to your mobile for peace of mind on the move, and adding carbon monoxide detection to the traditional set up. Peter Nieh, a partner a Lightspeed Venture Partners and a Nest investor, told theFinancial Times that the company’s “magic"" was its ability to “marry software and hardware in a way that makes them sing together ina customer experience.""How will Apple take this? If the quotation above sounds similar to the sort of marketing copy that usually turn up in an Apple advert it should come as no surprise. Nest CEO and co-founder Tony Fadell is a former Apple employee known as the""godfather of the iPod"", and many are surprised that the company sold to Google and not the iPhone makers. Business Insider has suggested that this could be due to long-standing tensions between Fadell and British-designer Jony Ive (credited with the look of Apple's most famous products and now head of industrial design at the company) but it isn't the end of an Apple relationship. Nest has always supported iOS and Android products equally and has said it will continue to do so in the future. Apple has yet to announce any decisive moves into the 'internet of things' market, but it has a number of products in its roster that would fit well. iBeacons, for example, has been described as an ""indoor GPS"" that tracks your exact location in a house, whilst Siri's voice recognition would also be useful in issuing commands at home. There's nothing definite from Apple yet, but expect something substanial down the line."

The deal is the culmination of a more than three-year relationship between Somerville, Massachusetts-basedEcho Nest and Spotify, which is considered an IPO candidate. Echo Nest technology blends machine learning and natural language processing--the respective expertise of co-founders and MIT doctorates Tristan Jehan and Brian Whitman--to build a database of songs and artists. The recommendation engine recognizes pitches, tempos and other similarities between songs and blends that data with a cultural understanding of songs and artists gleaned from blogs, music reviews and other online sources. The result: a recommendation engine that recognizes the meaning of lyrics in a Norwegian death metal ditty and knows they would not be appreciated by Christian music fans despite similarities in the syncopation. The Echo Nest engine has some similarities to the service offered by Pandora, with one major distinction: Other streaming music sites can, and have been, licensing Echo Nest technology as the personalization brain powering their operations for the past few years. Spotify officially integrated the Echo Nest technology with its Spotify Radio App in 2011.""We basically sell them Pandora in a box,"" said Echo Nest board member and Matrix Partners GeneralPartner Antonio Rodriguez, noting that a number of large Echo Nest customers keep their identities private.""They [streaming services] could try and develop this technology over several years or just buy it. It's a real revenue business.""In announcing the deal on their respective company blogs, Echo Nest and Spotify each wrote that EchoNest's API would remain available to developers for free. Neither company mentioned what impact the deal would have on Rdio, iHeartRadio and other Echo Nest customers. Neither company responded to a request for additional comment.Mr. Rodriguez, whose firm began investing in Echo Nest in 2010, declined to share terms of the acquisition, other than to say it was a combination of cash and stock. Founded in 2005 and employing 70, Echo Nest has raised roughly $25 million from Norwest VenturePartners, Matrix Partners and Commonwealth Capital. Echo Nest will maintain its 70-person team in Massachusetts.The Wall Street Journal reported in November that Spotify had secured nearly $250 million in new financing, with Silicon Valley-based Technology Crossover Ventures leading a funding round that valued the company at more than $4 billion.

Google has been one of the biggest proponents of this model, using info about its users to created profiles to sell to advertisers. Adding information about your home habits would surely be a boon to this. Fadell has stated that Nest’s privacy policy is going to stay unchanged, it seems pretty inevitable that sometime down the line this will change and Google will gain access to even more info about users’ daily routines. In addition to this here’s the problem of security. No connected device is 100 per cent secure, and the idea of having your home ‘hacked’ is even scarier than having your bank attacked. Is this a real carbon monoxide leak or are some kids setting off the alarm for a laugh? As well as handling data, Google will also be handling users’ security in a far more direct way than ever before. These sorts of problems – and the scepticism of users – won’t be easy to overcome. Is it all about robots? The Atlantic’s Alexis C. Madrigal points out that Nest doesn’t think of itself as a consumer tech company but as a robotics company with an emphasis on machine learning – training artificial intelligence to adapt and respond to human activity. In this light the acquisition would complement Google’s recent surge towards robots (a move that has taken the form of a shopping spree, including the purchase of Boston Dynamics), with Nest’s expertise adding some more brains to Google’s impressive hardware roster. Nest’s vice president of technology is one such expert: a “roboticist and artificial intelligence expert"" namedYoky Matsuoka who has told The Atlantic that her interest was in “how the human brain learns to do things and how machine learning comes in to augment that."

While that's a hefty 44% premium for Sapientshareholders, just how much of a game changer will the deal be for Publicis? Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said the acquisition has limited strategic impact for Publicis, which hasn't gained a meaningful edge in growth over its competitors despite its more aggressive push to scoop up big digital marketing firms. While Sapient's SapientNitro agency offers world-class digital marketing capabilities, Mr. Wieser in a research note Monday said those offerings ""are not sufficiently unique to offer meaningful strategic benefits for Publicis."" Additionally, the deal ""would make it harder for Publicis to pursue something that might actually be 'transformative' in the future, ""Mr. Wieser notes, adding that Sapient ""would make a Publicis acquisition of Interpublic much more unlikely than it already appears presently.""Alfred Fried analyst Richard Tullo in a note described the Sapient deal as ""convoluted"" for Publicis, as Sapient derives about two-thirds of its revenue from digital advertising and the rest from industrial artificial intelligence and government services. He added that the ""cultural fit should be ok,"" since Publicis already owns similar digital agencies such as Digitas and Rosetta. Meanwhile, Natixis analysts said the deal clarifies that ""Publicis is positioning itself in the area of digital services rather than technology.""Publicis Chief Executive acknowledged in a conference call earlier Monday that adding Sapient's consulting and technology services to its mix will help the company better deal with clients who are increasingly focused on reaching consumers through social media and e-commerce platforms. The Sapient deal is a clear signal that Publicis is maintaining its position of being a digital services business--unlike its rival WPP, which has taken a different route in adapting to the changing competitive landscape by going deep in ad technology. WPP, for example, recently invested $25 million in AppNexus, whose technology is used in automated ad buying. Publicis just six months ago walked away from a $35-billion plan to merge with rival Omnicom, a deal that would have created the world's largest ad holding company by revenue. Publicis' Chief Executive MauriceLevy has attributed the company's weak results in recent quarters to distractions related to the failed deal and has emphasized his goal to transform Publicis into a digital company. According to the company's most recent earnings report, digital made up roughly 42% of Publicis' revenue so far this year compared with 38%in the year-earlier period. Publicis investors are weighing what the deal might mean for shareholder return: shares were down more than 2% so far today."

It also simultaneously supports the creation and modification of ad-hoc models proven successful on various sized payment platforms, IBM said.Financial terms of the deal to acquire IRIS Analytics were not disclosed. IRIS Analytics is IBM's first acquisition of 2016.The IRIS technology acts as a virtual analyst to help identify new fraud patterns, and it applies machine learning models to help analysts detect fraud and act quickly to help reduce fraudulent events, the company said. IRIS bridges the gap between expert-driven rules and traditional predictive modeling by applying artificial intelligence and cognitive techniques to partner with human experts in suggesting best- fit analytics interactively. The company s technology also allows for testing and deploying models with real production data, as it happens and without downtime.""The cognitive computing approach unleashes a new paradigm in fighting fraud,"" said Alistair Rennie, general manager, Industry Solutions & Offering Management, IBM. ""The combination of IRIS Analytics with IBM'scounter fraud technology will help organizations more accurately detect fraud at scale and speed so that they are in a position to implement countermeasures quickly, with more control and transparency, while at the same time assists with dramatically lowering false positives.""Big Blue said only 16 percent of banks polled in a recent global IBM Institute of Business Value study said they could detect fraud as it is attempted. The study also showed that once new schemes were identified and confirmed, it is estimated that countermeasures typically require longer than four weeks to deploy. Existing fraud detection techniques are constrained by the dependency on specialized black box models that are hard to understand, explain, and adapt, IBM said. Moreover, as the payments industry continues to evolve with faster, alternative and mobile payments innovations and the expanding use of chip and PIN systems, fraudsters have become more technologically sophisticated and organized, adapting their fraud techniques more quickly to attack the new systems. According to IBM, IRIS is in use by leading banks and payment processors throughout the world. For example, the French payment card switch: e-rsb, operated by STET, uses IRIS for 5.5 billion annual credit and debit card transactions. ""With an average response time of less than five milliseconds per transaction even during peak periods when we are processing over 750 transactions per second, IRIS enables us to detect potential fraud without adding any notable overhead to our service, said Pierre Juhen, deputy CEO of STET. In addition, STET has been able to respond to newly identified fraud patterns by deploying new counter measures in a few hours without taking down the system, he said. Defenses against financial crime are in critical need of innovation and improvement. As the payments industry evolves with new payments methods such as chip and PIN, mobile payments and immediate payments, the ability for financial institutions to accurately make decisions about what is suspicious and what is legitimate before the payment is executed is required, said Constantin von Altrock, CEO of IRIS Analytics"

Components based on technology licensed by ARM are found in the vast majority of the world's smartphones, and the Cambridge-based group has branched into other connected devices as smartphone growth slows.ARM stands to be central to the tech industry’s shift to the ‘internet of things’ – a network of devices, vehicles and building sensors that collect and exchange data – a stated focus for SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son. Monday’s deal, Softbank’s largest to date, marks a departure for the Japanese group, whose tech and telecom portfolio ranges from U.S. carrier Sprint (S.N) to a stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba(BABA.N) and humanoid robot ‘Pepper’ – but does not yet include a major presence in the semiconductor industry. Under the offer backed by ARM’s board, Softbank will pay 17 pounds for every ARM share – a premium of more than 40 percent to Friday’s close.ARM shares surged nearly 43 percent to 16.99 pounds by 0820 GMT.“This is one of the most important acquisitions we have ever made, and I expect ARM to be a key pillar of SoftBank’s growth strategy going forward,” Son said in the statement. The acquisition is the first for Son, 58, since he last month rescinded plans to retire – effectively pushing out his heir apparent, former Google (GOOG.O) executive Nikesh Arora.S on, whose lucrative early investments include Alibaba, said then that he wanted to “cement SoftBank 2.0”, turn around loss-making U.S. carrier Sprint (S.N) and “work on a few more crazy ideas”.Though he has a low profile outside Asia, Son has long been an unconventional, charismatic visionary in the often closed and clubby world of corporate Japan, turning profits from Japanese telecoms into bets on up-and-coming start-ups. Not all have been a success: SoftBank’s $22 billion acquisition of a controlling stake in loss-making Sprint in2013 has left the group with hefty debts.SoftBank had an interest-bearing debt of 11.9 trillion yen at end-March, including 4 trillion yen at Sprint, and its net debt currently stands at 3.8 times core earnings.“SoftBank’s position as an entity outside the semiconductor industry allows ARM to retain its independence and protect existing customer relationships, while commitment to UK investment ensures management buy-in,” Jefferies analysts said in a note. “It’s difficult to see other suitors at this stage.” The ARM deal is one of Japan’s biggest deals overseas, outranking even Sprint, as SoftBank joins a parade of Japanese companies seeking growth abroad as the domestic economy stagnates. Softbank has raised nearly 2 trillion yen ($19 billion) in cash over the last few months through asset disposals, according to Son – including the sale of shares in China’s Alibaba, unusual for a group that has rarely exited investments. But analysts had expected it to use the cash to reduce debt or give shareholders a windfall by buying back its own shares. Instead, Son appears to have leapt on the opportunity presented by a battered sterling following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union last month, and a strengthening yen. Though ARM has warned on the staffing impact of Brexit, its revenues are largely in dollars, and its shares have climbed almost 17 percent since the vote. Under the offer on Monday, greeted by the UK government as proof that the economy is ‘open for business’, SoftBank said it was committed to keeping top managers, ARM’s headquarters and to at least double the employee headcount in Britain. Announcing plans to stay on last month, Son said he wanted to complete the transformation of SoftBank into a tech investment powerhouse. He has focused on what he calls the next ‘paradigm shift’ in technology, which includes artificial intelligence and the internet of things – both increasingly important for ARM as it weathers a smartphone slowdown. This year ARM bought UK imaging specialist Apical, which specializes in technology to allow computers to analyze images – replicating human vision using software. Analysts said on Monday that a counterbid was not impossible but also unlikely, as any rival bidder among arms customers or Chinese rivals could face regulatory challenges.SoftBank shares were not traded on Monday, a market holiday in Tokyo"

The takeout means a spectacular return for founders Mark Cummins and Charles Bibby, who established the company in 2014 and will now share over $80 million for their 51 per cent stake in the business. Pointy gives small retailers a way to make their stock visible online without having to invest in a full ecommerce system. Retailers connect a ""Pointy box"" to the shop's barcode scanner and then use their scanner as normal. The device is pre-paired with Pointy's website. The app directs shoppers to where particular items are available locally, rather than pushing them towards ecommerce giants such as Amazon. Once the retailer starts using the scanner, the system uses algorithms and machine learning to estimate stock levels. Pointy is expected to continue to operate from its own Dublin offices and develop its product platform. The deal is set to close in the coming weeks. Neither company disclosed the value of the transaction but London-based Balderton venture capitalist Rob Moffat congratulated the Irish company on its ""$160 million exit to Google"", describing it as a ""European Xoogler success story"".In a blog post, announcing the deal, the co-founders said: ""The last six years have been an incredible adventure, and today marks the start of a new chapter From small beginnings, we're very proud to serve local retailers in almost every city and every town in the US and throughout Ireland. ""By joining forces [with Google], we will be able to help people discover local stores and products on a much larger scale. We think this is the right way to accomplish what we set out to do - to bring the world's retailers online and give them the tools they need to thrive.""Local merchants Pointy has raised $19.2 million (€17.3 million) from investors over a number of years, including a Series B round in 2018 that yielded $12 million. The takeover means that those investors are likely to make a eight fold profit on their initial investment in the business. The company has previously partnered with Google, including on a ""see what's in store"" feature to help thousands of local merchants display the data within Google. Other partnerships include point-of-sale firmsLightspeed, Clover and Square. In a statement, Google said was ""excited to share that we've entered into an agreement to acquire Pointy that has helped thousands of local retailers bring their product inventory online"".The company's investors include Frontline Ventures, Polaris Capital, Draper Associates, Wordpress founderMatt Mullenweg, co-founder of Google Maps Lars Rasmussen, Transferwise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus and Bebo co-founder Michael Birch. Former Irish rugby player Jamie Heaslip also backed the company. Speaking last year, Mr Cummins said many shoppers prefer to buy an item in a store after inspecting it and speaking with an expert to buying it online and waiting for delivery.Mr Cummins started Pointy in 2014 after selling his previous start-up Plink to Google in 2010. Plink let users search the web using images rather than key words. He got the idea for Pointy following a party where he and friends enjoyed craft beer purchased from a near by supermarket. He wanted to buy the beer but couldn't remember the name of the store, which got him thinking you can search online for products around the world but you can't always find out what's on the shelf at the shop around the corner."

You probably see and hear it as much as I do when folks say, ""Microsoft needs to buy this company"" or ""Microsoft would do well to acquire this technology."" But, have you noticed it's never the popular companies that get swept up? Instead it’s the obscure companies that have names no one can pronounce at first glance. But, once you are made aware of a company through an acquisition announcement, you wonder why the company's technologies weren't already more popular and mainstream. Such is the case today. Microsoft has announced another acquisition of a company I've never heard of that produces a very interesting technology. Aoratois an Israeli company that develops Active Directory security solutions based on Machine Learning. It took me about 5 tries to figure out how to pronounce the company name and I'm sure I still got it wrong. I'd wait to hear a Microsoft person pronounce it, but no two Microsoft employees ever pronounce ""Azure"" the same. So, I won't hold out much hope there. Thankfully, a company video (see below) did help me wrap my mind around it. I mentioned during a webinar yesterday that I believe the company that provides the best, secure identity management solution will win the Cloud. And, I truly believe that – and I believe that Microsoft thinks it, too. We've seen recent advancements in the way Microsoft syncs on-premises AD to Azure AD, but with today's acquisition, the company is steaming ahead to better secure the identities contained in Active Directory. Aorota's technology uses Machine Learning to detect and identify suspicious activity in the corporate network.

Kosei was founded in April 2014 by Lance Ridel, an expert in machine learning, and Jure Leskovec, a Stanford professor in computer science who also focuses on machine learning. At Kosei, they created a product graph that basically was able to decipher and map the relationships between different products in a catalog, enabling it to make smarter recommendations to consumers. Kosei built a graph that understands more than 400 million relationship between 30 million products. For Pinterest, this could mean making better suggestions of photo galleries, or ""boards,"" to follow or pins to share, prompting users to stay on the site longer.""In a year we're really focused on international growth, how do I get a set of pins--not even ads--out to someone who has never been on the service, and give them a wall of pins that is really useful to them?"" said Michael Lopp, Pinterest's head of engineering, describing one potential example. ""That's not monetization, but it's another place that Kosei can help us with.""And when it comes to advertising, Pinterest can serve more relevant ads to users, an important bar as social peers Facebook and Twitter continue refining their targeting capabilities. Bradford says that better targeting is among the wish-list of items she often hears from clients, along with better conversion-tracking and showing how online exposure led to offline sales. Kosei's seven-person team, including the co-founders, will join Pinterest and report to Lopp. Financial terms of the acquisition--Pinterest's sixth to date--were not disclosed.

333,219,AIU200,Etsy,US29786A1060,23238,USA,ETSY,15291,20-09-2016,Blackbird Technology,Australia,,"It’s not just gigantic search engines that are looking to acquire tech and talent around emerging areas like speech recognition. Even design and craft marketplaces can use a little machine learning and artificial intelligence to make their wheels turn a little better. Today, the popular handmade-goods site Etsy announced it has acquired a startup called Blackbird Technologies, which developed algorithms for natural language processing, image recognition and analytics — similar to those used by Amazon and Google for product and other searches — and then “democratized” them to be used by any company of any size. At Etsy, the tech will be used to improve its own search features. Financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but we’re asking and will update if we learn more. The company’s employees — it appears there were around 10 — will all be joining Etsy. “The team possesses a deep expertise in Artificial Intelligence, search, and distributed systems and has direct experience working in these areas for some of the largest technology companies in the world,” Etsy  said in a statement. Little is known about Blackbird — no listings on Crunchbase or AngelList, a fairly unspecific website for Blackbird itself — and even Etsy’s announcement of the deal is light on company details. According to LinkedIn, though, the two co-founders are Nikhil Raghavan (CEO) and Manju Rajashekhar (CTO), who collectively had worked on similar technologies across places like Google, Twitter, Microsoft, Oracle and Yahoo. Because Etsy is going to be using Blackbird’s tech for its own platform, it seems that Blackbird’s current business plans, which deployed its tech by way of an API, will shut down. Customers had included Nasty Gal, ThredUP, and Tophatter. Etsy has had a fairly strong year so far, beating analysts’ expectations in two consecutive quarters on the back of growing sales and customer base. But at the same time, it’s facing some heat in the form of other competitors hot on Etsy’s crafty tail with their own marketplaces. The biggest of these is Amazon (perhaps every e-commerce company’s worst nightmare) with its own Handmade storefront that will vie for the same producers, the same customers, but throwing in some attractive Prime shipping (and one-stop shopping) into the mix. This is why buying Blackbird is a smart move. It will essentially help Etsy improve its search and discovery to point shoppers to items better matched to their tastes, and keep them from abandoning their shopping carts, a common pain point for any e-commerce enterprise. “Buyers come to Etsy.com for items they can’t find anywhere else and our goal is to help them discover exactly what they want among our 40 million unique listings. Leveraging Blackbird’s technology, we believe we can enhance the buyer experience by making search quicker and easier and by surfacing even more relevant, tailored product recommendations,” said Chad Dickerson, Etsy, Inc. CEO, in a statement. “Our team has already made substantial enhancements to the search & discovery process on Etsy, especially through features like Exploratory Search, and we are excited for Blackbird’s world-class team and technology to accelerate our progress in this key area.” Longer term, it seems that Etsy will look to use some of Blackbird’s tech in other areas beyond search, too. “In addition, longer-term, we believe there may be opportunities to deploy Blackbird’s Artificial Intelligence technology in areas beyond search that will help strengthen our markets and seller services platform,” the company said. This is Etsy’s sixth acquisition, but only its first since going public in 2015. Interestingly, it looks like the first Etsy has made that points directly to its technology around its product (Adtuitive, Etsy’s first buy, was a move to bring in some adtech to the business)."

349,,,"VMware, Inc.",US9285634021,,USA,VMW,92257,19-07-2019,Bitfusion,USA,,"VMware, Inc. today introduced a new integrated feature in VMware vSphere 7 that will enable enterprises to deliver elastic infrastructure on-demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)applications. This new feature—VMware vSphere Bitfusion—is developed out of VMware’s 2019 acquisition of Bitfusion, a pioneer in the virtualization of hardware accelerator resources including graphics processing unit (GPU) technology. Organizations use hardware accelerators such as GPUs to dramatically improve the performance of AI/MLworkloads that may run several hours or longer. IT teams have come to realize that these hardware accelerators are isolated islands—unable to be shared across many parts of the business. The inability to share those resources leads to inefficient and poor utilization of both existing and newly purchased resources. The combination of Bitfusion and VMware vSphere will help organizations achieve cost savings, enable resource sharing out of the box, and deliver the right hardware accelerator resource, like a GPU, to the right workload at the right time.“We aim to deliver the same value to GPUs that we delivered for CPUs,” said Ihab Farhoud, Director, Solutions Engineering – METNA, VMware Middle East, Turkey and North Africa. “By breaking down existing silos of GPU resources, organizations will be able to achieve better utilization and efficient use of them through sharing—resulting in immediate cost savings. More importantly, organizations will be able to jumpstart new or stalled AI/ML initiatives to drive their business forward by sharing those GPU resources with their teams on-demand with VMware vSphere 7.”VMware vSphere 7 with Bitfusion Enables Efficient GPU Pooling and SharingAI and ML-based applications—deep learning training in particular—rely on hardware accelerators to tackle large and complex computation. With the newly integrated Bitfusion capabilities, VMware vSphere 7 will enable enterprises to pool their powerful GPU resources on their servers and share them within their datacenters. That will enable organizations to efficiently and rapidly share GPUs across the network with teams of AI researchers, data scientists and ML developers relying on and/or building AI/ML applications. Released in April 2020, VMware vSphere 7 was rearchitected into an open platform using Kubernetes to provide a cloud-like experience for developers and operators. The Bitfusion feature of VMware vSphere 7 will leverage GPUs for applications running in virtual machines or containers. Bitfusion can operate in a Kubernetes environment such as VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, and is expected to run side-by-side as customers deploy AI/ML applications as part of an overall modern applications strategy. The Bitfusion feature of VMware vSphere will be available through a single download with no disruption to current infrastructure and will seamlessly integrate with existing workflows and lifecycles.VMware acquired Bitfusion last year with the intention to integrate the technology into VMware vSphere.Bitfusion offered a software platform that decoupled specific physical resources from the servers they are attached to in the environment. This included sharing GPUs in a virtualized infrastructure, as a pool of network-accessible resources, rather than isolated resources per serve"

Atlas 3D will join Siemens Digital IndustriesSoftware, where its solutions will expand additive manufacturing capabilities in the Xcelerator portfolio of software.Sunata(TM) software uses thermal distortion analysis to provide a simple, automated way to optimize part build orientation and generate support structures. This approach allows the designer--rather than the analyst--to perform these simulations, thereby reducing the downstream analysis that needs to be conducted via Simcenter(TM) software to achieve a part that meets design requirements. Siemens plans to make the Atlas 3D solution available through its online Additive Manufacturing Network.""We welcome Atlas 3D to the Siemens community as the newest member of our additive manufacturing team. Our solutions industrialize additive manufacturing for large enterprises, 3D printing service bureaus, design firms and CAD designers,"" said Zvi Feuer, Senior Vice President, Manufacturing Engineering Software of Siemens Digital Industries Software. ""The cloud-based Sunata software makes it easy for designers to determine the optimal way to 3D print parts for high quality and repeatability.

""Siemens is a leader in additive manufacturing, with the most integrated and functionally robust solutions in the industry, so we are excited to join the team,"" said Chad Barden, Chief Executive Officer of Atlas 3D. ""The power of Sunata is that it equips designers to more easily design parts that are printable, which helps companies more quickly realize the benefits of additive manufacturing. As part of Siemens, we look forward to introducing Sunata to customers who already have Siemens' AM solutions and can achieve new efficiencies in their front-end design-for-additive process, as well as companies who have yet to start their additive manufacturing journey.""The high rate of 3D print failures is a key challenge companies face in leveraging additive manufacturing for high-volume production. Parts often need to go through several design and analysis iterations before the optimal build orientation and support structures are determined.

367,,,Microsoft,US5949181045,186342,USA,MSFT,10107,22-06-2018,Bonsai,USA,,"Microsoft MSFT continues its acquisition spree with the recently announced deal to buy Bonsai, an artificial intelligence-based (""AI"") startup. Bonsai develops AI driven technology which improves the functioning of intelligent autonomous systems. The terms of the deal have been kept under wraps. Industries which leverage robotics, HVAC (Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) and other automated systems can benefit a great deal from Bonsai`s tech. The tech stalwarts are concentrating on training and taming machines for the required outcomes. Facial recognition, self-driving cars, unlock systems, are instances where advanced machine learning (""ML"") capabilities are extensively required. Microsoft is well poised to benefit from the path-breaking technology Bonsai brings on board. Notably, speculations are rife that the tech power house is working on an automated cashier less check out technology to counter Amazon`s AMZN Amazon Go stores. The automated tech of Bonsai is expected to aid the company in that project as well. Shares of Microsoft have returned 47.9% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry's rally of33.5%. This outperformance can primarily be attributed to its rapidly expanding efforts in AI and Internet of Things (""IoT"") based developments. Undisturbed focus on Azure remains a key catalyst. Focal Points of the AcquisitionMicrosoft sees a lot of potential of Bonsai`s ""reinforcement learning"" skills in industrial AI. The tech giant already boasts of an end-to-end compilation of AI tools Microsoft Cognitive Services. It comprises intelligent APIs to ensure developers can easily utilize advanced technologies in their applications. Furthermore, Gluonopen source interface and Open Neural Network Exchange (""ONNX"") format already assist deep learning. Microsoft will utilize Bonsai capabilities to power its Azure AI platform. Bonsai`s platform in MicrosoftResearch will lead to a one-of-a-kind ""AI toolchain"" which is expected to develop ""any kind of autonomous system"" for calibration and control tasks. This toolchain combined with Azure Machine Learning supported by Azure Cloud will be run on Azure IoT. Consequently, Microsoft can develop a comprehensive solution for enhancing, operating and building ""brains"" for autonomous systems. Per the company`s blog, autonomous systems in operation are envisioned to grow to approximately 800million by 2025. Moreover, Boston Consulting Group data, as revealed by Siemens, projects world wide spending in the robotics sector to reach $66.9 billion by 2025, compared with $26.9 billion in 2015. Bonsai`saddition to Microsoft`s AI portfolio is in sync with the company`s intention to gain from this immense growth. Capitalizing on the AI revolution We believe Microsoft is on the right track, given its increasing inclination towards AI ever than before. The company`s focus on strengthening presence in the AI market is evident from the acquisition of Berkeley, CLbased Bonsai. Notably, in the past month, Microsoft acquired Semantic Machines, which introduced an extensive approach for the development of conversational AI to advance its digital assistant Cortana. In 2017, the company acquired AI startup Maluuba, an expert in the field of deep learning and reinforcement learning for question-answering and decision-making systems. Furthermore, Microsoft acquired SwiftKet, anAI startup earlier in 2016 for $250 million. These AI-based startups widen the scale of prospects for the tech giant. The company has also realized the immense power innovative software developers possess and how it can aid the company explore lucrative market opportunities. Recent acquisition of GitHub, the world`s largest open-source code repository, for approximately $7.5 billion reinforces the company`s ML initiatives. TheGitHub-Azure integration will further strengthen Microsoft`s commitment to cloud-computing future as it aims to compete against the likes of Amazon and fellow tech giants. Per a recent report by Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to hit $35.9 billion by 2025 at a cagr of 57.2% with 2017 as the base year. The projected figure takes into account direct revenue sources. Given the huge growth prospect in the industry, Microsoft is putting its best foot forward to grab a major share of the projected revenue growth. Moreover, integration of AI techniques within Cortana, Office 365 and Azurepresents a significant competitive edge to the company, in our view."

Based in Vancouver, Avigilon makes security cameras, access control systems and the software that allows those devices to work smarter and provide more information to users. Avigilon president and COO James Henderson said the sale, first announced in February, gives Avigilon a huge opportunity for growth within Motorola, where it is expected to continue operating as its own business unit. Motorola is a long way from the company that made flip phones 15 years ago; these days, the company is heavily focused on systems for first responders. They make the command centres for first responders that connect central dispatch with the people in the field. Henderson said that Avigilon's expertise with video surveillance makes it a natural fit. ""We're bringing to the table the eyes to their ears. You know, they're a leader in voice and becoming a leader in other things,"" he said. ""We are a leader in video - video intelligence, video analytics, and high quality end-to end video solutions.""Avigilon is also deploying deep learning and artificial intelligence software that allows those surveillance cameras to do some incredible things.""It actually learns what it's looking at, and what is normal,"" Henderson said. ""People walking down a street is normal. Cars driving down the road is normal. Now, all of a sudden if people start running in all directions -something it's never seen before - it can trigger an alarm.""The systems can also detect attributes like hair colour, sex and clothing colour, which allows operators to look for individuals, searching through video footage coming from dozens, or even hundreds of cameras. By launching a cloud system for operators, Avigilon can also update security systems with new features over time. For some who follow the Canadian tech industry closely, watching another Canadian success story gobbled up by an American company brought a tinge of disappointment.""I've heard the rumblings of the disappointment, but to be quite honest, I hear that disappointment from analysts,"" Henderson said, with a hint of bemusement, adding that sale provided great value for shareholders. Carl Rodrigues, CEO and president of SOTI Inc. - a Mississauga based enterprise mobility management company - is a vocal advocate for growing Canadian startups at home, instead of seeing them sold once they get big enough.""I think there's a lower bar we set for ourselves,"" Rodrigues said.""I want to build a company that rivals a Google or a Facebook or a Tesla.

376,,,SNAP INC (Snapchat),US83304A1060,,USA,SNAP,16595,21-12-2018,Cimagine,Israel,,"In December 2016, Eyal Zak, an executive at a small startup called Cimagine, drove home to KibbutzMegiddo with some big news. He excitedly told his wife that Cimagine had been bought by the American company Snapchat. My son heard this and started whooping for joy,” says Zak. He rushed to tell all his friends – ‘My dad works for Snapchat! My dad works for Snapchat!’ He used that app all the time.”The Zak family weren’t the only ones taken by surprise by the entry of Snapchat (now called Snap) into Israel. The messaging app, on which messages and pictures are only accessible for a short time, was very popular with the young generation but not perceived as having any great technological vision. Cimagine, a small company from Kfar Yehoshua that had raised just a few million dollars, developed an augmented reality technology that made it possible to install” virtual furniture or other items in a house. The connection between the companies wasn’t totally clear then: Snap did not elaborate on its plans, and the Cimagine acquisition, for an estimated $40 million, was not officially announced. Cimagine became Snap’sIsrael research and development center, headed by Zak. Eleven months ago, Snap expanded its presence in Israel with the launch of a commercial section, headed by Assaf Sagy, to work with local advertisers and sell ads. Eyal ZakOfer VakninUntil now, however, Snap has kept its Israeli activity under the radar. Now, for the first time, executives agreed to talk about the challenges they contend with and their search for the next big thing. Snapchat has become one of the apps most associated with the young generation. With 186 million daily users, it is far from being an empire on the scale of Google or Facebook, and has just had a particularly hard year, but it still has tremendous influence on media, social networks and digital communication. Snap is responsible for a number of ideas and features that were later adopted by the tech giants and are now considered standard: messages with selfie pictures that are deleted after being sent; Stories – a series of pictures and videos that are deleted after 24 hours; Filters and Lenses – illustrations and animations that can be added to selfies, such as a dog’s ears and tongue, or a rainbow arcing out of a person’s mouth).In the past two years, Snap has had to sit by and watch Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook shamelessly copy these features in a to ingratiate itself with the young audience. Now, Stories, Filters and Lenses can be found on Facebook and all of the apps that it owns – Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. 1.1 billion people now use the Stories feature daily on the various Facebook platforms. At the beginning of 2016, Snap decided to upgrade the app’s Filters, Lenses and animation experiences and make them more realistic and more precise (for example, the illustrated dog’s ears must show up exactly on the user’s head, and a big tongue should appear when he opens his mouth).To make this happen, it needed to acquire computer vision and AR capabilities. Cimagine, founded in 2012by Yoni Nevo, Nir Daube, Ozi Egri and Amiram Avraham (who did not work in the company), fit the bill. There were companies in the global market that were developing a product similar to ours, but we were always one step ahead of them,” says Zak, who headed up the development of Cimagine’s mathematical engine at the time. We’d gotten to know Snap through various conferences and get-togethers. Then one day they called and the acquisition process started.”He adds: Snap is a serious company. They checked first to make sure the technology belonged to us and that we really developed it. They made sure we knew what we were talking about that our product really suited their needs.”Cimagine CEO Nevo headed up development at the time but recently left his position. Daube and Egri, the engineering and product team, moved to Snap’s Los Angeles headquarters. The technology developed by Cimagine eventually became World Lenses, one of Snapchat’s most popular features. Based on AR, it enables you to insert amusing virtual images in the world around you. For example, you could cause a dinosaur to wave its tail in the middle of the room, or insert a dancing hotdog with earphones."

In its place will come a front-facing 3D laser scanner for facial recognition. Adding merit to the rumour is another report from Israeli financial website Calcalist which states that Apple has acquired RealFace, an Israeli startup that developed deep learning-based face authentication technology. The terms of the deal aren't public, but it's estimated at ""several million dollars."" In his report Hall says the benefits of facial recognition over fingerprint recognition are that it is widely regarded as being more secure, something banks would prefer as mobile payment services expand; and that it will work well in wet conditions where Touch ID can be less reliable. The flip side is that facial recognition requires a more deliberate unlocking procedure of holding the phone upto your face which can be inconvenient and may make users more self-conscious than fingerprint unlocking. Facial recognition can also be less reliable for users who wear glasses, contact lenses or sunglasses, something the iris scanner in Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 faced. If implemented, the cutting edge technology won't come cheap. Hall says the scanner will add $10-15 more to the manufacturing cost of a phone compared to the Touch ID module currently being used. Coupled with the iPhone 8's widely reported switch to an OLED display and all new chassis, the changes are expected to push the iPhone 8's starting price over$1,000"

The company hired Baidu chief scientist Andrew Ng to lead the Silicon Valley Lab in2014 after about a year and a half at Google, where he founded and led the deep-learning Google Brain project. Then in January 2017, Baidu opened an augmented reality lab and hired Qi Lu, a former Microsoft executive and leading artificial intelligence (AI) expert.eMarketer notes that Baidu is looking for a way to generate an alternative income to augment it falling search revenue after the company faced criticism in China for the death of a student with cancer who used an experimental drug discovered through a paid-search campaign. As a result, Chinese regulator imposed new rules related to search ads. Baidu's revenue ""took a hit"" -- reporting its first decline in quarterly revenue, reports eMarketer, as a result of those new government rules.

The chipmaker announced Monday it will acquire Mobileye for $63.54 per share, a 34 percent premium to Mobileye’s closing price Friday. The blockbuster deal marks Israel’s biggest acquisition, and Intel’s second-largest after its $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera, a field-programmable gate array technology provider, in 2015. Mobileye is a leading developer of digital vision technology, which detects objects and space surrounding a vehicle, responsible for a number of key self-driving functions such as making sure that the vehicle stays in its lane and warning drivers of potential collisions. Its chips are installed in more than 300 car models, including BMW, according to Mobileye. The Israel-based company that currently employees over 600 workers was co-founded by Amnon Shashua, a computer science professor at Hebrew University, and CEO Ziv Aviram in 1999. Mobileye flagged $358 million in revenue last year, marking a net income of $108 million.“Intel’s landmark acquisition reflects the company’s strong will to promptly enter the self-driving car market. The company has missed out on the smartphone boom, and the personal computer market is shrinking,” said Kim Pil-soo, a professor of automotive engineering at Daelim University. With an aim to shift its business model, Intel has been expanding investments in driverless technology. It recently acquired deep learning chipmaker Nervana Systems last year, and FPGA maker Altera in 2015. Intel and Mobileye had already been working together with BMW to test-drive 40 autonomous cars in the US this year. Autonomous driving technology is estimated to grow into a $25 billion market by 2025, according to global consulting firm Bain & Company. Intel created Automated Driving Group, a division dedicated to autonomous driving, spun out of the Internet of Things business last November. The chipmaker also launched a new brand for its software and hardware tools for the development of driverless vehicles, dubbed Intel GO, in January.Intel’s latest acquisition follows a slew of active acquisitions made between global information technology firms and auto parts makers. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics announced last week it had completed the acquisition of HarmanInternational Industries, a US car and audio systems maker, at $8 billion. Last year, US ride-sharing company Uber Technologies spent $680 million in purchasing self-driving truck company Otto, established by Anthony Levandowski, a former Google executive.US carmaker General Motors acquired Cruise Automation, an autonomous vehicle software producer, for some $1 billion last July.

It creates programs that use natural-language processing, which helps computers understand dialogue and develop reasoning capabilities in areas of research known as deep learning and reinforcement learning. Microsoft and Maluuba declined to disclose the purchase price. With Maluuba's software, for example, workers at large organizations can type a request to locate an employee with specific knowledge, such as a tax-law expert. Maluuba's natural-language technology would then sift through documents, emails and corporate directories to pinpoint the best person, according to a blog post from Harry Shum, Microsoft's executive vice president in charge of artificial intelligence. Like many competitors, Microsoft is racing to beef up its artificial-intelligence capabilities. Last April, Salesforce bought deep-learning startupMetaMind, and in August Apple Inc.picked up machine-learningspecialistTuri Inc. Last September, Microsoft created an artificial-intelligence division with 5,000 employees, putting Mr. Shum in charge. The division includes both product managers and researchers, a pairing Microsoft hopes will accelerate the rollout of artificial-intelligence offerings. Maluuba's technology has been used in smartphones and televisions from brands such as Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. A year ago, at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, the company worked with Qualcomm Inc. in a demo that let drivers communicate with an intelligent voice interface in a Maserati car. At that time, Maluubaalso raised $9 million from investors including Emerillon Capital and Nautilus Ventures to expand research and development. Maluuba has raised $11 million in total, according to co-founder SamPasupalak.Ever since Satya Nadella became chief executive nearly three years ago, Microsoft has been on an acquisition tear. It has picked up more than three dozen companies since, and elevated executives from acquired companies to senior posts to guide Microsoft in emerging businesses.

We had the rare opportunity to invent and lead a product category, Cloud HPC, Cycle ComputingCEO Stowe noted in a separate blog post announcing the deal. Zander said the acquisition would combine Azure public cloud infrastructure such as GPU processing capabilities and support for Infiniband networking with Cycle Computing's orchestration and HPC heritage.The combination would enhance our support of Linux HPC workloads and make it easier to extend on-premise workloads to the cloud, Zander asserted. Microsoft is the only major cloud provider currently supporting Infiniband. The big computing deal would also seek to leverage Microsofts recently announced plans to add GPUinstances based on Nvidia's Pascal generation of graphics processors to its Azure cloud. Azure currently includes Nvidia M60 and K80 GPU instances, and the cloud vendor said it would add P40- and P100-based virtual machines later this year. Google, IBM and other public cloud providers have also moved to integrate deploy Nvidias Pascal GPU into their cloud infrastructure as customers run compute intensive workloads. Those upgrades target AI and deep learning workloads as well as HPC workloads such as DNA sequencing and Monte Carlo simulations. Those capabilities mesh with Cycle Computings current customer base that includes biomedical researchers and financial firms that use its cloud HPC software and orchestration tools to access cloud-based computing resources. Cycle Computing, which in the past has had strong ties to Microsofts cloud rival, Amazon Web Services, has also played a key role in transforming HPC technology as a provider of software that links users to the cloud.HPC workloads are always changing and perhaps the definition of the HPC along with it, but I think whats really happening is the customer demographics are changing, Tim Carroll, head of ecosystem development and sales, told HPCwire earlier this year.

396,,,Google,US02079K1079,160329,USA,GOOG,13628,01-07-2020,North,Canada,,"Google confirmed today via blog post that it has acquired Canadian smart glasses company North, which began life as human interface hardware startup Thalmic Labs in 2012. The company didn’t reveal any details about the acquisition, which was first reported to be happening by The Globe and Mail, last week. The blogpost is authored by Google’s SVP of Devices & Services Rick Osterloh, which cites North’s “strong technology foundation” as a key driver behind the deal.Osterloh also emphasizes Google’s existing work in building “ambient computing,” which is to say computing that fades into the background of a user’s life, as the strategic reasoning behind the acquisition. North will joinGoogle’s existing team in the Kitchener-Waterloo area, where North is already based, and it will aid with the company’s “hardware efforts and ambient computing future,” according to Osterloh.In a separate blog post, North’s co-founders Stephen Lake, Matthew Bailey and Aaron Grant discuss their perspective on the acquisition. They say the deal makes sense because it will help “significantly advance our shared vision,” but go on to note that this will mean winding down support for Focals 1.0, the first-generation smart glasses product that North released last year, and cancelling any plans to ship Focals 2.0, the second-generation version that the company had been teasing and preparing to release over the last several months.Focals received significant media attention following their release, and provided the most consumer-friendly wearable-glasses-computing-interface ever launched. They closely resembled regular optical glasses, albeit with larger arms to house the active computing components, and projected a transparent display overlay onto one frame which showed things like messages and navigation directions.Around the Focals 1.0 debut, North co-founder and CEO Stephen Lake told me that the company had originally begun developing its debut product, the Myo gesture control armband, to create a way to interact naturally with the ambient smart computing platforms of the future. Myo read electrical pulses generated by the body when you move your arm, and translated that into computer input. After realizing that devices it was designed to work with, including VR headsets and wearable computers like Google Glass, weren’t far enough along for its novel control paradigm to take off, they shifted to addressing the root of the problem with Focals. Focals had some major limitations, however, including initially requiring that anyone wanting to purchase them go into a physical location for fitting, and then return for adjustments once they were ready. They were also quite expensive, and didn’t support the full range of prescriptions needed by many existing glasses-wearers. Software limitations, including limited access to Apple’s iMessage platform, also hampered the experience for Apple mobile device users. North (and Myo before it) always employed talented and remarkable mechanical electronics engineers sourced from the nearby University of Waterloo, but its ideas typically failed to attract the kind of consumer interest that would’ve been required for sustained independent operation. The company had raised nearly$200 million in funding since its founding; as mentioned, no word on the total amount Google paid, but it doesn’t seem likely to have been a blockbuster exit. In an email to North customers, the company also said it would be refunding the full amount paid for any Focals purchases — likely to defray any complaints about the end of software support, which occurs relatively soon, on July 31, 2020"

Terms of the deal were withheld. Based in London, Big Data Partnership was founded in 2012 and has a practice in big-data software, including Apache Hadoop. It has customers in the U.K., Europe and China. Big Data Partnership had raised 4.35 million pounds ($5.69 million)from investors including the private-equity firm Beringea. Teradata is up against Amazon Web Services, whose first-quarter revenue of $2.57 billion topped Teradata's entire annual revenue for 2015. Earlier this month, Teradata's shares were downgraded by CLSA from buy to underperform on concerns that open source software and cloud-based alternatives to data warehousing (i.e. data warehousing as a service) were hurting Teradata's core business, according to Barron's.

411,,,Salesforce,US79466L3024,157855,USA,CRM,90215,19-02-2016,PredictionIO,USA,,"Salesforce has made another acquisition to build out its technology in machine learning and big data analytics: the company has acquired PredictionIO, a startup based out of Palo Alto that had developed an open source-based machine learning server. Salesforce  plans to use some of the tech to build out Salesforce’s own machine learning capabilities as part of SalesforceIQ, both in-house as well as in products for Salesforce customers, the startup’s CEO and co-founder Simon Chan said in a blog post announcing the acquisition. But the company will also continue to serve third-party developers, he added. A Salesforce spokesperson has also confirmed the acquisition but without further elaboration. “Salesforce has signed a definitive agreement to acquire PredictionIO,  but don’t have anything to share beyond [PredictionIO’s] blog post at this point,” she said. Chan noted that the startup’s team — which includes other co-founders Donald Szeto, Kenneth Chan and Thomas Stone — will be joining Salesforce after the transaction closes. You can think of PredictionIO as MySQL for machine learning, as Steve described it when the startup announced a $2.5 million seed round in 2014. The company’s tech, as an open source and essentially free product, makes it more affordable and faster for developers to build machine learning-based products like recommendation or prediction engines. Originally called TappingStone when it was founded in 2012 in London, the startup at first had built a product that it described as “Machine Learning as a Service” before pivoting to an open source model. aUnder that new direction, the company had developed some traction, with some 8,000 developers and 400 apps powered by its technology. As a point of reference, that’s double the number of developers in the community as of 2014. Two things will be happening post-acquisition, Chan says. First, PredictionIO’s tech will remain open source and free to use, while the team works on “evolving the project into a self-sustaining community.” As part of that the PredictionIO Cluster software on AWS Cloudformation will come down to $0. There is no word on whether Salesforce will plan to develop and support a paid enterprise edition of the product down the line. Second, PredictionIO will be put to work at a very large, specific company: Salesforce itself. Specifically, it will become a part of SalesforceIQ’s machine learning capabilities to “enhance intelligence across the Salesforce clouds.” “Being a part of Salesforce will give us an amazing opportunity to continue building our open source machine learning platform on a much larger scale,” Chan writes"
412,,,Salesforce,US79466L3024,157855,USA,CRM,90215,14-12-2015,MinHash,USA,,"Salesforce has acquired MinHash, TechCrunch has learned. Salesforce confirmed to us that it has acquired the young startup based in Palo Alto co-founded by two data science engineers formerly with eBay and Avaya. MinHash had developed an AI platform as well as a “personal assistant” called AILA to crawl to and from the many corners of the Internet, pull out relevant trends for marketers, and help them construct campaigns around those trends. Salesforce could be making this acquisition to build out its big-data analytics for marketers, but it isn’t sharing the details of what the MinHash team will be working on. MinHash was a young company that had not raised more than a seed round — with its small group of investors including Raymie Stata, the ex-CTO of Yahoo, via the Start Smart Labs incubator co-founded by him, and Amit and Arihant Patni. Still, with many marketers looking to tap into advances in big data analytics and machine learning to improve their work, MinHash was already working with five of the world’s largest online retailers to help them with marketing projects. A note on MinHash’s home page confirming the sale notes that customers will not be able to use the platform after January 21, 2016. While the MinHash product may no longer work after that point, the company’s tech and team of four engineer employees — co-founders Jayesh Govindarajan and Naren Chittar, as well as Anuprit Kale and Edgar Velasco — are all coming over to Salesforce,  where it looks like they may be rebuilding a version of the product to work there, as part of the company’s search and data science teams. That could include features like tracking user behavior and creating interest graphs for particular audiences; clustering algorithms to target “lookalike” audiences; and scanning of sources surfacing trending keywords and other signals automatically and doing it with continuity with a company’s existing (and other company’s existing) campaigns and what ever other information that you feed to it. Perhaps most eye-catchingly, MinHash’s team designed the whole product around AILA, its own AI-based character who customized everything based on the person using it. “We’re excited to share the news that the MinHash team is joining Salesforce,” the note on MinHash’s site says. “At Salesforce, we will continue to pursue our passion for search, data science and machine learning on a much broader scale.” We’ve reached out to Salesforce for more detail on the purchase beyond a generic statement from a spokesperson that simply said: “We can confirm the MinHash team is joining Salesforce.” This is Salesforce’s 34th acquisition and follows several others in the wider area of big data analytics, including customer relationship platform RelateIQ for $390 million in 2014 and earlier this year, smart calendar startup Tempo AI."
413,,,Salesforce,US79466L3024,157855,USA,CRM,90215,29-05-2015,Tempo AI ,USA,,"The company was incubated by SRI International, the birthplace of the voice-powered (and Apple-acquired) assistant Siri. When Tempo launched two years ago, founder and CEO Raj Singh pitched it as another type of assistant that automatically brings up relevant information for your meetings. For example, when I look up today’s meetings in the Tempo app, I can view a map of the location (plus look up nearby parking lots or call an Uber), bring up social media posts from everyone invited and read related emails and documents. If it’s a conference call, I can also join the call with one tap (a small touch, but one that makes dialing long conference pass codes much more bearable). In an announcement on the Tempo website, the startup says: We started Tempo to build an assistant for the mobile business professional. The calendar was the perfect interface, since it’s the beat of our professional lives. With Tempo, we created a smart calendar, using artificial intelligence to enable the next generation of mobile productivity. We brought context to your events and automated many of your tasks, just like a real-world assistant, saving our users millions of minutes. Tempo goes on to say that joining Salesforce  allows it to “continue our mission at a much larger scale.” Which makes sense — it’s easy to imagine Salesforce customers wanting this kind of smart calendar. In fact, some of the earliest additions to the app seemed tailored for sales and business users. Whether that means Salesforce will use Tempo’s technology or is basically just hiring the Tempo team isn’t clear. Regardless, it’s bad news for users of the existing Tempo app, which is no longer accepting new users. The company plans to fully discontinue the app on June 30."

In addition to launching self-driving rides in Pittsburgh with the help of Volvo, the company is acquiring Otto and its all-star team according to a new report from Bloomberg. Otto  has been focusing on self-driving technology that could be fitted into trucks that are already on the road now. In other words, Otto didn’t want to develop its own self-driving vehicles — the startup chose to focus on some sort of self-driving kit instead. Otto makes its own lidar sensors.This fits perfectly into Uber’s strategy as the company doesn’t want to become a car manufacturer. Instead, Uber has been looking at partnerships with existing car manufacturers, such as Volvo, in order to turn their cars into self-driving cars using Uber’s proprietary technology. So get ready for Uber’s self-driving kit. And then, there’s Otto’s team. Anthony Levandowski is well-known in the self-driving space as he used to work for Google on Google’s self-driving car effort in its early days. Otto’s Lior Ron was head of product at Google Maps. Given that mapping is a key element of self-driving cars, Ron’s experience could help as well. Other engineers at Otto have worked at Tesla, Apple and Google. According to Bloomberg, Uber doesn’t want to dismantle this team of 91 employees, so Levandowski will lead Uber’s self-driving project, and the existing Otto office in San Francisco will become an Uber R&D center. Combining Otto’s technology with Uber’s massive push in mapping makes Uber stronger than ever when it comes to putting self-driving cars on the road. Uber will also be able to use its huge user base to tap into ride data and improve its mapping solution. Uber has no choice but to build self-driving technology if it wants to remain competitive for on-demand rides. It’s clear that prices will drop drastically once Uber can get rid of the driver in the front seat."

Alex Newman is a committer of open source code to the Hadoop ecosystem, whose code has been used in production for over 10 years. He has worked in big data, network protocol design, software security and application development, including working on HBase for Cloudera. Ryan Rawson is a Core Committer of HBase open source code and a member of the HBase Project Management Committee. Before co-founding OhmData, Ryan was a software engineer at Google, where he worked on Google's 'Big Table' forerunner to HBase, and Amazon, where he developed synchronous cross-data centre distributed business logic. He specializes in large systems, (hundreds of nodes or servers), extensive code bases and multiple language environments. OhmData's unique expertise in design and development of databases is an important element of WANdisco's product development strategy. Working alongside WANdisco's existing Big Data and distributed computing experts such as Dr. Yeturu Aahlad, Dr. Konstantin Shvachko, Dr. Konstantin Boudnik and Jagane Sundar, they will enhance WANdisco's ability to develop further ground-breaking technology, not least because of their ability to commit new Hadoop code to improve integration between WANdisco's products and the Hadoop Open Source platform. WANdisco has already demonstrated that, by applying its patented active-active replication technology to Hadoop, it can make Hadoop resilient for enterprise deployments. OhmData will continue this work with HBase to significantly add to WANdisco's ability to execute in the Big Data market. Gartner analysts Merv Adrian and Nick Heudecker see HBase and other additional components as key to the relevance of Hadoop and comment: ""As Hadoop core and related projects have progressed, its viability as a platform has been enhanced and substantial numbers of vendors in multiple categories, such as business analytics, data integration and workload management, have introduced products that assume its presence. Version 2.x of Apache Hadoop enables greater scalability and availability and expands beyond its batch processing roots to encompass new workloads and processing styles.""* David Richards, Chief Executive Officer of WANdisco comments: ""We have again demonstrated that WANdisco can attract the top talent in the industry. Alex and Ryan come to us having worked as core technologists at some of the biggest names in the industry such as Google, Cloudera and Amazon. HBase is a critical component of the Hadoop stack and customers have told us that they need it to be continuously available. We are delighted to have added the OhmData team to our renowned Hadoop organization""."
