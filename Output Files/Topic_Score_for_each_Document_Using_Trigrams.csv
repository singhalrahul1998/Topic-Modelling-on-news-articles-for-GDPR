Terms of the Indix deal were not disclosed.Avalara intends to use the Indix AI to maintain and expand its tax content database, which includesinternational product codes and classifications, taxability rules, exemption conditions, tax holidays,jurisdictions, boundaries, tax rates, thresholds, registration, compliance, and return preparation and filingrequirements. According to Avalara, maintaining tax content and global product information is difficult andresource-intensive, requiring specialized technology, expertise, and human resources. Collecting new contentand tracking changes can be a highly manual process — by applying Indix’s AI to this problem, Avalarabelieves it will be able to automate the aggregation and accurate maintenance of its tax content.“Global taxing authorities govern compliance through ever-changing rules and requirements, and the task ofgathering and maintaining this data is core to the value Avalara provides,” said Scott McFarlane, co-founderand CEO of Avalara, in a statement. “We believe the combination of deep product knowledge, broad productcontent, and artificial intelligence technology will allow us to provide our customers the information they wantand need to factor compliance into their business decision-making, and for Avalara to address morecompliance requirements to support their growth.”“Avalara and Indix share a similar global vision,” added Sanjay Parthasarathy, CEO of Indix. “From Day One,we built Indix to collect, organize, and structure the world’s product information using artificial intelligence.With the addition of the Indix expertise, Avalara will be able to efficiently and rapidly refine its content to meetthe expanding and evolving needs of its customers.”"

of mobile apps.
The deal is the 13th this year by Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), with the largest being its $2.8 billion June
acquisition of Massachusetts-based e-commerce software business Demandware.
It was involved in the bidding war for LinkedIn before Microsoft scooped up the professional networking
business for $26 billion and was also rumored to be mulling a bid for Twitter, which is thought to be worth
about $13 billion.
Other Bay Area startups bought this year by Salesforce include a $700 million acquisition of San Francisco
marketing analytics business Krux in October. It did two big deals in August: a $410 million purchase of San
Francisco productivity software business Quip and the $110 million acquisition of San Mateo-based analytics
startup BeyondCore."

IDC also forecasted that worldwide spending on artificial intelligence (AI) will reach $776billion by 2022. Sonasoft is well-positioned to gain significant market share in a large existing market that ispoised to accelerate with an anticipated adoption of AI. The Company also intends to integrate OPtimAIze'splatform into Sonasoft's existing AI platform, NuGene.OPtimAIze's AI platform has unique capabilities that automatically identify and manage risk associated withdeveloping and releasing software updates to an existing software product or platform. Sometimes theseupdates adversely impact the product's functionality, which in turn negatively impact customer satisfactionand brand reputation. Managing these risks and determining how these updates interact with the product as awhole is a big challenge. Most software development teams are limited to narrow knowledge domains thatcan miss compatibility problems that can negatively affect users.To counter these challenges, OPtimAIze developed an AI platform that has an exclusive data-driven processthat automatically identifies and predicts the risk of compatibility conflicts early in the software developmentprocess. As a result, software engineering teams can be confident that their final releases and fixes willfunction as intended.""To advance our AI platform to specifically hone in on solutions for software product development, capitalizeson a significant emerging market opportunity,"" said Vikas Agrawal, Sonasoft's Chief Innovation Officer andfounder of OPtimAIze. ""Through our AI-enhanced automation, we can now solve a problem that regularlytests the trust and confidence of information technology users with their technology providers. Our AI platformis built on the latest artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies, which provideunprecedented visibility into potential compatibility problems of a software release well before it goes live.This is an area where AI will favorably impact the experience of virtually all technology users while reducingthe software industry's direct and indirect costs of maintaining their products. In the last six months, we'vecome a long way since our initial efforts to develop AI solutions for IT infrastructure and operations to expandinto the field of AI for software development.""""Sonasoft has now acquired three AI companies this year with the acquisition of OPtimAIze, well ahead ofeven our most optimistic expansion scenario,"" said Frank Velasquez, CEO of Sonasoft. ""Those who haveever updated their software and found that key components were no longer working properly, understand thevalue proposition that our new technology will bring. As software becomes more complex and cybersecurityrisks are ever-increasing, the software industry needs to take more proactive software update qualityassurance measures to maintain functionality, security, and customer satisfaction.

ConversionPointaims to raise around $45 million, with 6.1 million shares offered between $6 and $7 each.Such a deal would value the company at nearly $ 190 million.About $23 million in proceeds from the offering would pay the cash portion of the Inuvo deal, with theremainder largely going to pay down debt.Inuvo's stock would stop trading if the deal with ConversionPoint is completed, and the combined companywould be based in Newport Center, where ConversionPoint employs about 85 people.The company would remain led by Chief Executive Robert Tallack.The company's based in the Pacific Financial Plaza office complex that also holds the headquarters of virtualreality broadcasting firm NextVR Inc., local offices of law firm Irell & Manella LLP and others.Inuvo shareholders are scheduled to vote on the impending sale to ConversionPoint on May 8-they'd own alittle under 30% of the combined company's stock-and the IPO is expected to be finalized shortly after that.ConversionPoint plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol CPTI.The offering is being underwritten by Op-penheimer & Co., GMP Securities and D.A. Davidson & Co., whilethe Irvine offices of Troutman Sanders LLP are handling much of the legal work for the IPO.Al, SaaSThe marriage between Conversion-Point and Inuvo hinges on the promise of computers simulating intelligentbehavior.Specifically, leveraging artificial intelligence to boost online retail sales, and glean the shopping habits andcharacteristics of hundreds of millions of consumers. ConversionPoint plans to leverage Inuvo's technology to expand into higher margin offerings, such as software and managed services, while moving away from its legacy e-commerce business. Its mission is to provide a ""data driven"" Al-powered e-commerce platform for small- and mid-sized businesses, the company stated in regulatory filings. Both companies are coming off of down years, marked by falling sales and rising losses. Inuvo, which was established in 1999, saw revenue decline 7.8% to $73.3 million in 2018. The company attributed the decline to cutting ""non-strategic technologies including a proprietary marketing platform."" The revenue decrease, according to the company, led to a $5.9 million net loss in 2018, compared to a loss of about $3 million the prior year. Inuvo revenue is highly concentrated and reliant upon Yahoo, Google and Microsoft Online. The three giant service providers last year accounted for nearly 87% of sales, with Yahoo alone driving more than 71 % of revenue, according to the filing. ConversionPoint, launched in 2015 in Irvine, reported revenue of nearly $40 million last year, down 20%. It works with firms including Walmart, Lowe's, Costco and Office Depot and other major online retailers, which integrate the company's JavaScript tags on their online retail store web pages, allowing Conversion-Point's brand customers to ""directly publish interactive experiences and product information to such retail websites."" The company in the second quarter last year shifted its focus from e-commerce product sales-a segment dominated by Amazon.com-to further develop and expand managed services and its software as a service, or SaaS, business. The moves slashed revenue from its e-commerce business 51% to $20.3 million, while cutting product
offerings from nine to four. Its e-commerce products primarily are sold through trial offers, in which consumers must opt out of monthly billed subscriptions. The pivot, combined with increased operating expenses, drove a loss of $33.2 million last year, compared to net income of $400,000 in 2017. On a positive note, revenue from managed services doubled to $16 million, while SaaS revenue climbed more than 1,000% to $3.5 million, largely as a result of its $17.2 million buy of Sellpoints Inc. in late 2017. Growth Plans The combined company will have revenue of about $113 million and 145 employees once the merger is completed. Managed services will account for nearly 80% of revenue, followed by e-commerce, 18%, and SaaS, 3%. ConversionPoint wants to boost SaaS sales to 60% of annual revenue, and eventually eliminate its
e-commerce line completely. It coveted Inuvo's high-margin AI-powered IntentKey product, which it plans to upsell to customers. The technology is used by Fortune 500 companies to help attract consumers to specific landing pages or to take action. The software stores and updates more than 500 million, anonymous consumer profiles, and processes 20 billion ads per day, identifying some 24 million concepts, such as objects, ideas, emotions and places. Inuvo technology pushes a billion marketing messages to consumers every month.

Grapevine will play a pivotal role in SSC'sconsumer asset digitization strategy.This acquisition is integrally linked with SSC's 4+2+1 Strategy to drive growth across its core product areaswhich are--1) Fixed Income-based Financial Digital Assets, 2) Consumer Tech Digital Assets, 3) Commodityand Energy Digital Assets, and 4) TradeTech Digital Assets.Targeting the Social Media Influencer market, estimated to have reached a market size of $2 billion in 2017,Grapevine has become a world leader in facilitating the collaboration between advertisers/brands andvideo-based social influencers/content creators.

These brands essentially hire social media influencers to deliver specific marketingrequirements. Through bookings, Grapevine captures fees from brands as well as a service fee from hiredinfluencers. Additionally, Grapevine provides a white glove Agency model where the Company works closelywith big brands to deliver high quality marketing results with leading influencers.Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence technology, core assets for SSC, enable seamless and decentralizedcollaboration between counterparties, eliminating the need for a central authority. Blockchain can be used fora wide variety of applications, such as tracking the ownership of digital assets, keeping decentralizedtransactional records and establishing verified consensus.By applying blockchain-enabled technologies such as smart contracts and the tokenization of assets toGrapevine's existing ecosystem and existing social media influencer business model, SSC looks torevolutionize the way influencers and celebrities alike, engage with fans, brands and communities on a globalscale.By empowering influencers via a token-based model, they will be able to more effectively build their brands,monetize their work, and engage with their audiences. The ability to provide influencers with newmonetization paths, as well as fans and brands with exclusive access to these influencers and their services,is a massive opportunity.Additionally, the acquisition of Grapevine allows for unique access to high impact influencers from topcelebrities through micro-influencers. SSC will be pursuing celebrity tokenization opportunities that mayinclude and facilitate access to merchandise, exclusive interactions, and other value added services asinfluencers grow in popularity. With Grapevine, tokenized celebrity influencer monetization opportunities canbe taken to new heights. Further, Grapevine will accelerate SSC's penetration into customer loyalty programs, consumer financing,and the asset securitization market. The combination of loyalty management programs and blockchaintechnology can bring immense efficiencies to cash rewards, pre-paid cards and coupons bringing numerousmarket efficiencies, cost reductions, and enhanced brand loyalty. In the U.S. alone, customer loyaltymemberships have reached 3.8 billion.Also, of note, the integration of AI for risk management and blockchain technology into Grapevine's corebusiness model will act as a force enabler for Grapevine and also provide strategic capability for SSC. TheCompany will leverage the global reach of Grapevine's growing social media follower network that isaccessed by Grapevine's Social Media Influencers. This reach provides for enhanced consumer marketing aswell as digital asset creation and sales. Furthermore, as blockchain-based transactions become more prolificand asset digitization of securities and non-securities grow, the ability to access large audiences will continueto be of incredible value.""We are very excited to welcome Grapevine and its robust and vibrant network of influencers and brands tothe SSC family,"" said Bruno Wu, Executive Chairman & CEO of SSC.
